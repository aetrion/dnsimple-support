When you create a Google Apps account and you want your email to be delivered to your Google Apps mail account, Google provides you with a set of MX records that you need to add to DNSimple.

Each MX record includes a priority value, which is a relative value compared to the other priorities of MX records for your domain. Addresses with lower values will be used first. Therefore, when a mail agent wants to deliver an email to you it would first attempt to deliver to `aspmx.l.google.com`. If that server cannot handle the delivery it would then move onto `alt1.aspmx.l.google.com`, and if that server cannot handle the delivery then it would move onto `alt2.aspmx.l.google.com`, and so on.\r\n\r\nMX records make it easy to define what servers should handle email delivery and allows you to provide multiple servers for maximum redundancy and ensured delivery."},{"title":"Securing your DNSimple Account","slug":"account-securing","category":"Account","content":"Here are some simple rules to follow to help make your DNSimple account more secure:\r\n\r\n- Use a password for your account that includes letters, numbers and punctuation characters.

The following steps will hopefully help you avoid any downtime while transferring so that the process is as smooth and easy as possible:\r\n\r\nFirst, set up your account on DNSimple, activate your account and add the domain *without* transferring it. This will give you the chance to fully set up and test your DNS records *before* you move the domain. Remember that when you add your domain name it should be the domain only and not subdomains. You will add subdomains as DNS records in the next step.\r\n\r\nFor example: create and activate your account, navigate to your domain list and click Add a Domain. Enter just the domain name in the Domain Name box, without any subdomains, as in \"example.com\". Do *not* add the \"www\" prefix.\r\n\r\nNext, add the DNS records for the domain. To do this you can either use the Add Services to Domain feature in the domain's management screen to add all of the DNS records for common services like Google Apps, or you can add records one-by-one using the Advanced Editor.\r\n\r\nOnce you've added all of the records for your domain, use a tool like `dig`, which is a command-line tool, to verify each of the records.\r\n\r\nExample: `dig @ns1.dnsimple.com mydomain.com any` will return all of the DNS records for the base domain. To look up details for a subdomain: `dig @ns1.dnsimple.com www.mydomain.com any` will return all of the DNS records for the subdomain www under the domain mydomain.com.\r\n\r\nAfter you have verified all of your records with a tool such as dig, then you should switch your name servers from your current name servers to DNSimple's name servers. You will do this at your current registrar. This step is essential as it ensures that your DNS will continue operating during the transfer process. The DNSimple name servers are ns1.dnsimple.com, ns2.dnsimple.com, ns3.dnsimple.com and ns4.dnsimple.com. Each registrar is different in how you change the name servers for a domain, however all of them should allow you to make this change.\r\n\r\nOnce the name servers are changed to DNSimple you will need to wait for the DNS information to propagate. This means that name servers that are currently caching your domain's DNS records will need to be given time for their caches to clear and to begin reporting the records from DNSimple's name servers. On your domain's manage page you should see the Domain Status as \"Active\" once the propagation has completed. We test against a variety of public name servers provided by organizations such as the Google, OpenDNS and Level3. You may also want to verify against your local name servers.\r\n\r\nExample: if your domains are using DNSimple's name servers then this following command should show this: `dig mydomain.com ns`. This will list the name servers for the domain.\r\n\r\nOnce you're satisfied that the DNS setup is complete and DNSimple is providing DNS service for your domain then you may begin the transfer process without concern for downtime.\r\n"},{"title":"DNSimple Status Page","slug":"dnsimple-status","category":"DNSimple","content":"We make our current system status as well as our uptime history available at [status.dnsimple.com](http://status.dnsimple.com/).\r\n\r\nWe strive to always have at least one name server responding to queries at all times.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Downtime on a single server does not indicate downtime for the system as a whole."},{"title":"DNSimple Prices","slug":"dnsimple-prices","category":"DNSimple","content":"DNSimple DNS hosting is billed as a monthly service.

This method is available if you create an account via their website. To use this method first configure your DNS at CloudFlare. Next, \"Manage\" your domain at DNSimple, follow \"Change Name Servers\", and enter CloudFlare supplied name servers.\r\n- Through third-party \"Certified Hosting Provider Partners\". In this case DNSimple manages automatic provisioning and configuration of your CloudFlare account and DNS template. This greatly simplifies CloudFlare integration for your domain plus you're able to continue using DNSimple features. \"Manage\" your domain, press the \"One-Click Services\" button near the top of the page, and \"Add\" CloudFlare.\r\n\r\n## DNS limitations\r\n\r\nCloudFlare caches your site content at locations across the globe. It uses DNS to route your requests to one of these locations depending on various factors. To support this technology within DNS limitations it is best to use a host name (i.e. www.example.com) rather than your domain apex (i.e. example.com). CNAME records at a domain apex are disallowed or will cause your DNS respond incorrectly. You may wish to use DNSimple's URL redirection record to forward requests from your domain apex to \"www\" for instance.\r\n\r\n## ALIAS record limitations\r\n\r\nDNSimple offers a virtual record type called an ALIAS record. This allows sites to work around a limitation of CNAME records at the domain apex by resolving to an A record at the name server. Because CloudFlare may use the name server physical location to determine how your request will be routed it would short circuit the utility of CloudFlare. As such we advise against using ALIAS records with CloudFlare."},{"title":"\"Product Expiration\" Notification","slug":"product-expiration-notification","category":"DNSimple","content":"The **Product Expiration** email contains the list of products (purchased domains, certificates and whois privacies) expiring within 2 months, grouped by expiration range.\r\n\r\n![Email](http://f.cl.ly/items/0s0s093n1T2m3h3w3d0v/notifications-expiring.png)\r\n\r\nThere are four expiration ranges: in a day, within a week, a month and 2 months.

Check [this list of common domain resolution errors](/articles/domain-resolution-issues) to determine whether the domain is resolving with DNSimple.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Check you are using a fresh DNS cache\r\n\r\nBy default every DNS record lookup is cached up to the value specified in the time-to-live (TTL) setting of the record itself.\r\n\r\nWhenever you change a record, the old record value may live in your cache until the expiration giving you the impression the update was not performed.\r\n\r\nThis is the result from a fresh `dig` query for the record `www.dnsimple.com`. Notice the `ANSWER` section.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dig www.dnsimple.com\r\n\r\n; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> www.dnsimple.com\r\n;; global options: +cmd\r\n;; Got answer:\r\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 63190\r\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\r\n\r\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\r\n;www.dnsimple.com.

If I make a change now, it may not be visible from my local machine for an hour.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, make sure to clear the DNS cache before checking a record update. This may involve:\r\n\r\n1. Clearing system level DNS cache\r\n1. Restart browser sessions\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to check the changes with a mobile device or another computer outside of your local home or office network.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Check record propagation delay\r\n\r\nIf you recently changed a record it may take awhile for the change to propagate. This is especially true if the record has been cached by your local ISP.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, you can bypass a propagation delay by passing a custom name server in the `dig` call.\r\n\r\nThe following command checks the DNS record against the `ns1.dnsimple.com` name server.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dig www.dnsimple.com @ns1.dnsimple.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the response is the one you expect, it means the record has been updated in our system but the changes still need propagate. In all likelihood, they will be visible after the TTL period.\r\n\r\nYou can check against any of [DNSimple's name servers](/articles/dnsimple-nameservers).\r\n\r\nIf the query is not returning the correct value make sure there isn't a delay in the record update. See the section *Check record update delay*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Check record update delay\r\n\r\nWhenever you change a record in our system, the changes are published almost immediately.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, our update queue may take a little bit longer.

RapidSSL for normal, single name certificates and Comodo for wildcard certificates.\r\n\r\nThere are three broad steps to installing a certificate.\r\n\r\n- Generating a private key and a certificate signing request (CSR). \r\n- Requesting a CA validate your identity and sign the certificate. \r\n- Installing your private key and the certificate on your server.\r\n\r\n## Private key and certificate signing request\r\n\r\nDNSimple will automatically generate these if you like. They will be available to download once generated. You may choose to permanently delete the private key stored at DNSimple to increase your security. Be sure you have stored the private key safely as it is the only way to use your SSL certificate.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may generate your private key and CSR using publicly available tools that are beyond the scope of this article.\r\n\r\nThe certificate is uniquely associated to a single name or a wildcard name. You need to [select the hostname](/articles/ssl-certificate-hostname) during the purchase.\r\n\r\n## Certificate authority validation and signing\r\n\r\nThese types of certificates are verified via email only.\r\n\r\nA CA will present several common email addresses for your domain to choose from (i.e. admin@example.com, webmaster@example.com, etc). In addition to these the CA will present the email address listed as your administrative contact for your domain. \r\n\r\nIf you don't have (and don't want to configure) any of these common email addresses your domain administrator email address is easiest to change. To change it follow \"Contacts\" at the top of the page on DNSimple, then \"Manage\" your domain, and follow \"Change Contacts\".\r\n\r\nIf domain privacy is enabled you may wish to disable it long enough for the CA to retrieve your real admin email address.\r\n\r\nAfter submitting your request you will receive a message containing a link to validate your identity at the email address you selected. Be sure to check your junk folder in case it was inadvertently routed there.\r\n\r\nIt may take up to four days to receive your validation email and, once validated, signed by the CA. In general we see certificates being signed the same day.\r\n\r\nEvery so often we see a certificate held up by the CA for other reasons. If you feel its taking longer than expected please contact DNSimple support and we will investigate.\r\n\r\n## Installing your private key and certificate\r\n\r\nEach software package (web, email server, etc.) may have a unique method to install private keys and certificates.\r\n\r\nPlease see these certificate authority installation instructions for various packages:\r\n\r\n- [RapidSSL](https://knowledge.rapidssl.com/support/ssl-certificate-support/index?page=content&id=SO16226&actp=LIST&viewlocale=en_US)\r\n- [Comodo](https://support.comodo.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&_a=view&parentcategoryid=95&pcid=1&nav=0,96,1)\r\n\r\nYou may also find the following guides useful:\r\n\r\n- [Heroku Guide for DNSimple Certificates](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-dnsimple)\r\n- [Ryan McGeary's Guide](http://ryan.mcgeary.org/2011/09/16/how-to-add-a-dnsimple-ssl-certificate-to-heroku/)"},{"title":"Troubleshooting Domain Resolution Issues","slug":"domain-resolution-issues","category":"DNS","content":"In order to use DNSimple's managed DNS service your domain should resolve with DNSimple.\r\n\r\nYou can check domain resolution status using [Is It DNSimple?](http://isitdnsimple.com/). Resolution status is also displayed on the domain page in your DNSimple account.\r\n\r\nHere's a checklist of common issues to help you in case a domain is not resolving correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Name server propagation delay\r\n\r\nIf you recently pointed the domain to DNSimple and the domain is still not resolving, please note that it may take up to 24 hours for a name server change to propagate.\r\n\r\nYou can check whether the update was successful by inspecting the WHOIS response for the domain as described in the section *Check name server list in the WHOIS response*.\r\n\r\nThe WHOIS response is normally updated in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nIf after 24 hours the domain is still not resolving, make sure the update was successfully confirmed by your current domain registrar and see the other sections in this page.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Check the domain is using the DNSimple name servers\r\n\r\nEnsure the domain is using [DNSimple name servers](/articles/dnsimple-nameservers).\r\n\r\nIf not, update the name server to [point to DNSimple](/articles/pointing-domain-to-dnsimple).\r\n\r\nYou can use `dig` or any other DNS tool to get the name servers for the domain.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dig NS example.com +short\r\nns1.dnsimple.com.\r\nns2.dnsimple.com.\r\nns3.dnsimple.com.\r\nns4.dnsimple.com.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe order of the name servers is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Check the domain with +trace\r\n\r\nThe `+trace` option from `dig` shows exactly how the name is delegated.\r\n\r\nIt executes a recursive query against each of the name servers in the chain, starting from the root name servers. It's useful to debug delegation issues.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dig NS example.com +trace\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe delegated name servers should match [DNSimple name servers](/articles/dnsimple-nameservers).\r\n\r\nIf not, update name servers to [point to DNSimple](/articles/pointing-domain-to-dnsimple). If you recently switched the update may be in progress. See the sections *Check name server list in the WHOIS response* and *Check name server propagation delay*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Check the domain is using *all* DNSimple name servers\r\n\r\nDNSimple provides four name servers.

The owner is requested to prove admin right by receiving and confirming an email sent to an administrative email for the domain, or by configuring some specific DNS records for the domain.\r\n\r\nThe order normally takes from a few minutes to a few hours.\r\n\r\nIf the certificate is valid and signed by a trusted authority, the browsers indicate a successfully secured HTTPS connection.\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/0L1c3U0q450g2t1K3R18/dnsimple-ssltypes-https.png)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** DNSimple currently provides both [single-name and wildcard](http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates) domain-validated certificates.\r\n\r\n### Organization Validated SSL Certificates\r\n\r\nThe Organization Validated SSL Certificate (OV certificate) validates the domain ownership, plus organization information included in the certificate such as name, city, state and country.\r\n\r\nThe validation process is similar to the domain validated certificate, but it requires additional documentation to certify the company identity.\r\n\r\nThe order can take from a few hours to a few days, due to the company validation process.\r\n\r\nThe Organization Validated SSL Certificates display the company information in the certificate details.\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2v1L363P0Q0N3G3V0J15/dnsimple-ssltypes-company.png)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** DNSimple currently doesn't provide organization-validated certificates.\r\n\r\n### Extended Validation SSL Certificates\r\n\r\nThe Extended Validation SSL Certificate (EV certificate) requires an extended validation of the business. It validates domain ownership and organization information, plus the legal existence of the organization. It also validates that the organization is aware of the SSL certificate request and approves it.\r\n\r\nThe validation requires documentation to certify the company identity plus a set of additional steps and checks.\r\n\r\nThe order can take from a few days to a few weeks, due to the extended validation process.\r\n\r\nThe Extended Validation SSL Certificates are generally identified with a green address bar in the browser containing the company name.\r\n\r\n![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3608163u2b2n2U1D3p3T/dnsimple-ssltypes-greenbar.png)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** DNSimple currently doesn't provide extended validation certificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n## SSL Certificates by Secured Domains\r\n\r\nAn SSL certificate is associated to one or more secured host names that restrict the scope of a certificate.\r\n\r\n## Single-name SSL Certificates\r\n\r\nSingle-name SSL certificates protects a single subdomain (hostname).\r\n\r\nFor example, if you purchase a certificate for `www.example.com` it will not secure `mail.example.com`.\r\n\r\nOn sole discretion of the certificate authority, if you purchase a single-name certificate for the www hostname (www.example.com) the certificate may also include the root domain.\r\n\r\nDNSimple currently provides [single-name certificates](http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates).\r\n\r\n## Wildcard SSL Certificates\r\n\r\nSingle-name SSL certificates protects an unlimited number of subdomains of a single domain.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you purchase a certificate for `*.example.com` if will secure `foo.example.com`, `bar.example.com`, etc. It will not secure `foo.else.example.com`.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** DNSimple currently provides [wildcard certificates](http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates).\r\n\r\n## Multi-Domain SSL Certificates\r\n\r\nMulti-domains SSL certificates protects different domains with a single certificate.\r\n\r\nYou can normally secure a combination of different subdomains from different domains.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** DNSimple currently doesn't provide multi-domain certificates.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nIt's important to remember that the validation level and the number of secured domains don't affect the security level offered by an SSL certificate.\r\n\r\nAll certificates work with the following encryption principle.\r\n"},{"title":"Renewing an SSL Certificate","slug":"renewing-ssl-certificates","category":"SSL Certificates","content":"An SSL certificate renewal is effectively a new SSL certificate purchase. The easiest thing to do is to have us automatically generate the CSR (and a new private key to go with it) and submit the order. Once the new certificate is generated you can go through the same process for installing the private key and certificate as you would with any new SSL purchase.\r\n\r\nAll DNSimple SSL certificates are valid for one year from their purchase date. Sixty days before the certificate expires you will begin receiving renewal notices.\r\n\r\nWhen you renew a certificate, you will need to go through the [certificate approval process](/articles/ssl-certificates-email-approval) again since a new certificate will be issued. **If you don't approve the certificate, the renewal is not completed**.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT:** A renewal will not extend your existing certificate expiration date, it will result in a brand new certificate that must be installed.\r\n\r\nYou may have more than 1 certificate for a host name at DNSimple at the same time, so renewing your certificate prior to the expiration date of your current certificate will not affect your operations. Note, however, that you will only be able to install 1 certificate on your server at a time.\r\n\r\n## RapidSSL\r\n\r\nFor single host SSL certificates issued by RapidSSL, if you renew prior to the current certificate's expiration date your new certificate expiration date will be extended as follows:\r\n\r\n* 46 - 90 days before expiration date, extend 3 months\r\n* 16 - 45 days before expiration date, extend 2 months\r\n* 15 days or less before expiration date, extend 1 month\r\n* Up to 15 days after expiration date, extend 1 month\r\n\r\nThis extension will be from the new certificate's purchase date.\r\n\r\n## Comodo\r\n\r\nWildcard certificate will not be extended so you should purchase your new wildcard certificate close to your old certificate's expiration date, but with enough time for the certificate to be issued. 1 week before expiration should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n## Heroku\r\n\r\nIf you are using your certificate on Heroku then you may find https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-dnsimple helpful when preparing and deploying your newly issued certificate.\r\n"},{"title":"What is an A record?","slug":"a-record","category":"DNS","content":"The *A* in A record stands for *Address*. Simply put, an A record is used to find the address of a computer connected to the internet from a name. Whenever you visit a web site, send an email, connect to Twitter or Facebook or do almost anything on the Internet, the address you enter is a series of words connected with dots.\r\n\r\nFor example, to get to this blog you may have followed a link from another web site pointing to blog.dnsimple.com. In my DNSimple account is an A record that points blog.dnsimple.com to the IP address 72.32.231.8.\r\n\r\n![A Record](http://f.cl.ly/items/072v403p2I0T3e2a1B0F/dnsimple-record-a.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhen you clicked on this link your computer probably asked a nearby DNS server \"Is there an address record for blog.dnsimple.com?\". If the server can answer this question then it replied with: \"Yes, the address for blog.dnsimple.com is 72.32.231.8\". If it cannot answer the question directly then it probably went and asked another DNS server if they have the answer, and that server either answered or asked another server, and so on. This process is called \"resolving\" and is the way that all DNS requests are handled on the Internet. How it does it isn't important right now, what matters is that ultimately a DNS server answers with the correct answer and your web browser now knows that it should request the DNSimple blog's home page from 72.32.231.8.\r\n\r\nYou can actually do quite a bit more with A records, including using multiple A records for the same domain in order to provide redundancy. Additionally multiple names could point to the same address, in which case each would have it's own A record pointing to the same IP address.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line: A records are used to map a name to a computer's address on the Internet, and are one of the primary records used in DNS servers."},{"title":"Common DNS Records","slug":"common-dns-records","category":"DNS","content":"DNS is full of jargon - look, I can't even say the name without resorting to an acronym. The good news is that most domain names only need a few things to function correctly.\r\n\r\nFirst, if you are using any one of the services we support (like Google Apps, Heroku, Posterous, etc.) then you should just use our services feature to add the services you need to the domain. It's pretty simple: log in, go to the domain's manage page and click *Add Services to Domain*.\r\n\r\nIn addition most domains will likely want to lead visitors to a web site. Your hosting company will often provide you with 1 or more IP addresses for your web site. These will be something like `34.23.149.20`.\r\n\r\nTo point your domain to an IP address like this add an [A record](/articles/a-record). Leave the Name field blank and fill in the Address field with the address provided by your hosting company. If you host with someone like Heroku or Amazon AWS, where they provide you a hostname instead of an IP address, then you can use the [DNSimple ALIAS record](/articles/alias-record) to point `yourdomain.com` to the hostname.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to have `www.yourdomain.com` point to `yourdomain.com`. \r\n\r\n1. Create a [CNAME record](/articles/cname-record) with the name `www`\r\nand with value `yourdomain.com`.\r\n2. Create an URL forwarding record pointing the name `www` to `http://yourdomain.com` which will cause the URL visitors see to switch `www.yourdomain.com` to `yourdomain.com`.\r\n"},{"title":"Why anycast DNS?","slug":"why-anycast-dns","category":"DNS","content":"The DNS protocol most often uses UDP to ship packets around the internet. UDP being a stateless protocol enables an optimization based on “anycast”.\r\n\r\nMore often than not you want to talk to a specific computer on the internet. When a packet is sent to another computer on the internet the many routers in between make forwarding decisions according to their routing table. As your packet meanders through each router those tables get your packet closer to the one computer you’re after. This is “unicast”.\r\n\r\nWhen your customer looks up an IP address for your app they query DNS. All of our name servers have identical answers so we don’t care which one answers. With anycast we use internet routing capabilities to make it happen quicker.\r\n\r\nPacket latency is largely a function of geographic distance. With anycast we tell routers the same server is located at a bunch of different spots around the internet. Because internet routers are always optimizing routes they pick the one closest to your customer. Moving DNS servers closer mitigates this geographic latency component.\r\n\r\nWhile lower latency is the primary benefit we also gain resilience at the same time. Instead of four name servers we now have forty. If any of these forty go offline they’re removed from the routing table and others automatically pick up the slack.\r\n\r\nFinally, DNSimple’s ALIAS record type is a second-order DNS query. Since our anycast server is likely to be closer to the target geographic location an ALIAS record may resolve to a closer datacenter if your app is also geographically distributed.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in trying our our Anycast network, sign into your DNSimple account and enable Anycast on each domain's Manage page. In the near future we will be moving all of our name servers to Anycast as well, so you'll no longer need to do anything special to take advantage of the benefits of Anycast."},{"title":"Differences Between A, CNAME, ALIAS and URL Records","slug":"differences-between-a-cname-alias-url","category":"DNS","content":"A records map a name to one or more IP addresses when the IP addresses are known and stable. CNAME records map a name to another name and are only used when there are no other records on that name.\r\n\r\nThe general rule is use an A record if you manage what IP addresses are assigned to a particular machine. If, on the other hand, the IP addresses can change and you don't control those changes then you might use a CNAME record, as long as that is the **only** record for that specific name. If you use a CNAME record for a name like www.example.com then you can't use other records like MX for that same name.\r\n\r\n**You should never use a CNAME record for your registered domain name (i.e. example.com).**\r\n\r\nIf you cannot use a CNAME record and you do not control the IP addresses, then you may use either an ALIAS record or a URL forwarding record. An ALIAS record will automatically resolve to the hostname's IP addresses. They have a short time-to-live and thus will reflect changes to the hostname's IP addresses quickly and may safely be used with other DNS records (like MX and NS records).\r\n\r\nURL forwarding records on the other hand are not really DNS records. A URL forwarding record indicates that our web server should perform a 301 HTTP redirect and thus it will return an A record pointing to our redirection server.\r\n\r\nNote that if you want to use SSL on a name you cannot use our redirection server."}]
