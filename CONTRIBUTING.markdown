# Contributing to DNSimple's support docs

:tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute, you are awesome :tada:

Could you please do me a favor? If you are adding images to your pull request, do you mind running this quick rake task for me?

```
$ rake imgoptim
```

This makes sure that all the images that we serve are optimized and compressed in size. Slimmer images, happier children!  

Think of the children.

Thanks in advance!
