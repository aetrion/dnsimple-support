The text file follows the BIND format and includes information about all the records the domain has.</p>\n<p>You can use zone files to get a representation of all the records of a particular domain. You can use these files to accomplish various goals, like bulk migrating a domain zone to a secondary name server on a third-party system, or creating a backup of your domain records.</p>\n<p>Zone files are a standard practice in the DNS industry, so you can also use zone files to get your domain working on DNSimple for the first time. You just have to get your domain&#39;s zone file from your current provider and import it.</p>\n<h2>Importing records from a zone file</h2>\n<p>You can add records to your domain by importing a <a href=\"#whats-a-zone-file\">zone file</a>.</p>\n<note>\nImporting a zone file won't delete or replace the existing domain's records.\n</note>\n\n<div class=\"section-steps\" markdown=\"1\">\n##### How to import records from a zone file\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Log in to DNSimple with your user credentials.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Select the relevant account.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>On the header, click on the <label>Domains</label> tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Locate the relevant domain, and click on the name to access the domain page.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Go to the settings section by clicking the <label>Settings</label> link on the left.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Click on the <label>Import from a zone file</label> link inside the zones card.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/import-zone.jpg\" alt=\"Import zone link\"></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Paste the content from the zone file into the text area, and click <label>Import Zone</label>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The results of the import will be displayed, including any errors that may have occurred.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/zone-import-results.png\" alt=\"Zone file import results\"></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2>Exporting records to a zone file</h2>\n<p>You can export your domain&#39;s records into a <a href=\"#whats-a-zone-file\">zone file</a>.</p>\n<p>The resulting zone file will allow you to copy over all the domain&#39;s records to a third-party system.

UDP being a stateless protocol enables an optimization based on &quot;anycast&quot;.</p>\n<p>You usually want to talk to a specific computer on the internet. When a packet is sent to another computer on the internet, the routers in between make forwarding decisions according to their routing table. As your packet meanders through each router, those tables get your packet closer to the computer you want. This is &quot;unicast&quot;.</p>\n<p>When your customer looks up an IP address for your app, they query DNS. All our name servers have identical answers, so it doesn&#39;t matter which one answers. With anycast, we use internet routing capabilities to make things faster.</p>\n<p>Packet latency is largely a function of geographic distance. With anycast, we tell routers the same server is located in various spots around the internet. Internet routers optimize routes, so they pick the one closest to your customer. Moving DNS servers closer mitigates geographic latency.</p>\n<p>Lower latency is the primary benefit, but we gain resilience at the same time. Instead of four name servers, we now have forty. If any of these go offline, they’re removed from the routing table, and others automatically pick up the slack.</p>\n<p>DNSimple&#39;s ALIAS record type is a second-order DNS query. Since our anycast server is likely to be closer to the target geographic location, an ALIAS record may resolve to a closer datacenter if your app is also geographically distributed.</p>\n","data":{"title":"Why Anycast DNS?","excerpt":"Anycast offers several advantages over Unicast, resulting in lower latency and better traffic distribution.","categories":["DNS"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/why-anycast-dns"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>Domain WHOIS Privacy protection</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-whois-privacy\">WHOIS Privacy protection service</a> keeps your contact information private for a domain.

The use of the SAN extension is standard practice for SSL certificates, and it&#39;s on its way to <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-common-name/#common-name-vs-subject-alternative-name\">replacing the use of the common name</a>.</p>\n<h2>SAN certificates</h2>\n<p>A <strong>SAN certificate</strong> is a term often used to refer to a <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-types/#multi-domain-ssl-certificates\">multi-domain SSL certificate</a>. An SSL certificate with more than one name is associated using the SAN extension.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a subtle difference though. When using the term &#39;multi-domain certificates&#39;, we&#39;re generally referring to an SSL certificate that has the ability to cover multiple host names (domains). If we use the term &#39;SAN certificates&#39;, we&#39;re probably referring to a particular certificate that includes any name in the SAN extension.</p>\n<p>From a technical standpoint, every certificate issued today is effectively a SAN certificate, as the CA/B forum requires the certification authority to add the content of the common name to the SAN as well. Even if the certificate covers a single name, it will still use the SAN extension and include that single name.</p>\n<p>In practice, the terms &#39;SAN certificates&#39; and &#39;multi-domain certificates&#39; are synonymous, and generally indicate a certificate product where issuers can associate more than one domain by specifying the content of the SAN (directly or indirectly). These certificates are often marketed as &quot;special&quot; and priced differently than standard certificates, because you can associate more than one name.</p>\n<h2>SAN restrictions</h2>\n<p>There&#39;s no specific limitation on the host names you can cover with a SAN extension, besides the requirement to be syntactically valid host names (further details are available in the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6818\">RFC</a>). However, certificate authorities may impose further limitations on the number or formats based on internal rules or business decisions.</p>\n<p>For example, it&#39;s common practice to disallow arbitrary wildcard names as SAN host names. This means SAN certificates generally support only a specific list of names.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s also common to encounter a limit on the number of names per certificate, usually up to 100.  </p>\n<p>Finally, names are generally not required to belong to the same domain. It&#39;s fine for a certificate to cover a list of names like this:</p>\n<pre><code>example.com\nwww.example.com\nfoo.bar.hello.com\nanother.domain.com</code></pre><h2>SAN certificates and DNSimple</h2>\n<p>DNSimple provides SAN SSL certificates issued by the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/letsencrypt\">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a> certification authority.</p>\n<p>For current platform limitation, all the names must belong to the same domain:</p>\n<pre><code>example.com\nwww.example.com\nmail.example.com\nfoo.bar.example.com</code></pre><h2>Background</h2>\n<p>The X.509 specifications regulate the <em>Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate</em>, which includes the SSL certificates format. Originally, SSL certificates only allowed the designation of a single host name in the certificate subject called <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-common-name\">Common Name</a>.</p>\n<p>The common name represents the host name that&#39;s covered by the SSL certificate. Trying to use the certificate for a website that doesn&#39;t match the common name will result in a security error, also known as <em>host name mismatch</em> error. </p>\n<p>After the original specificaton, it became clear it would be helpful to have a single certificate to cover multiple host names. The most common example is a single certificate covering both the root domain and the www subdomain. In fact, it&#39;s common to reuse the same SSL certificate for <code>example.com</code> and <code>www.example.com</code>.</p>\n<p>The X.509 specification allows users to define extensions to be attached to a <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-csr\">Certificate Signing Request (CSR)</a> and the final server certificate. Using the SAN extension, it&#39;s possible to specify several host names in the <code>subjectAltName</code> field of a certificate. Each of these names will be considered protected by the SSL certificate.</p>\n","data":{"title":"What is the Subject Alternative Name (SAN)?","excerpt":"The Subject Alternative Name (SAN) is an extension to the X.509 specification that allows to specify additional host names for a single SSL certificate.","categories":["SSL Certificates"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ssl-san"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>What is a Root SSL Certificate?</h1>\n<p>A <strong>Root SSL certificate</strong> is a certificate issued by a <strong>trusted <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-certificate-authority\">certificate authority (CA)</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>In the SSL ecosystem, anyone can generate a signing key and sign a new certificate with that signature.

In the case of web browsers, root certificates are packaged with the browser software.</code></pre><ol>\n<li><h4>How do I install the Intermediate SSL certificates?</h4>\n<p>The procedure to install the Intermediate SSL certificates depends on the web server and the environment where you install the certificate.</p>\n<p>For instance, Apache requires you to bundle the intermediate SSL certificates and assign the location of the bundle to the <code>SSLCertificateChainFile</code> configuration. Conversely, NGINX requires you to package the intermediate SSL certificates in a single bundle with the end-user certificate.</p>\n<p>We provide a certificate installation wizard which contains installation instructions for several servers and platforms. If you purchase a certificate with us you will be able to <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/installing-ssl-certificate\">use this wizard to obtain and install the files you need</a> for your server.</p>\n<p>If your server is not on the wizard, you can still obtain the proper files through it and then follow the documentation of your web server to determine how to properly install your domain certificate and intermediate certificates.</p>\n</li>\n<li><h4>What happens if I don&#39;t install an Intermediate SSL certificate?</h4>\n<p>If you don&#39;t install one or more intermediate SSL certificate, you break the certificate chain. That means you create a gap between a specific (end-user or intermediate) certificate and its issuer. When a device cannot find a trusted issuer for a certificate, the certificate and the entire chain from the intermediate certificate down to the final cerficate can&#39;t be trusted.</p>\n<p>As a result, your final certificate will not be trusted. Web browsers will display an &quot;Invalid certificate&quot; or &quot;certificate not trusted&quot; error.</p>\n</li>\n<li><h4>How can I shorten the SSL certificate chain in my browser?</h4>\n<p>This is not possible. The only way to shorten a chain is to promote an intermediate certificate to root. Ideally, you should promote the certificate that represents your Certificate Authority, in this way the chain will consist in just two certificates.</p>\n<p>However, root certificates are packaged with the browser software and the list cannot be altered if not from the browser maintainers.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","data":{"title":"What is the SSL Certificate Chain?","excerpt":"The difference between the root certificate, intermediate certificates, and server certificate.","categories":["SSL Certificates"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ssl-certificate-chain"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>What is the Certificate Signing Request (CSR)?</h1>\n<p>The <strong>Certificate Signing Request</strong> (also <strong>CSR</strong> or <strong>certification request</strong>) is a block of encrypted text that is sent to the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-certificate-authority\">Certificate Authority</a> in order to apply for a certificate.</p>\n<p>The CSR contains information that will be included in your certificate, such as the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-common-name\">common name</a> and the company/owner details.

The SAN allows issuance of multi-name SSL certificates.</p>\n<p>The ability to directly specify the content of a certificate SAN depends on the Certificate Authority and the specific product. Most certificate authorities have historically marketed multi-domain SSL certificates as a separate product. They&#39;re generally charged at a higher rate than a standard single-name certificate.</p>\n<p>On the technical side, the SAN extension was introduced to integrate the common name. Since HTTPS was first introduced in 2000 (and defined by the <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818\">RFC 2818</a>), the use of the commonName field has been considered deprecated, because it&#39;s ambiguous and untyped.</p>\n<p>The CA/Browser Forum has since mandated that the SAN would also include any value present in the common name, effectively making the SAN the only required reference for a certificate match with the server name.

Any application compatible with this specification can be used to generate a DNSimple two-factor verification code.</p>\n<p>There lots of time-based two-factor authentication apps that generate verification codes. Here are some we recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447\">Google Authenticator</a> for Android, Blackberry, and iOS devices</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\">1password</a> for Mac, iOS devices, and Windows</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/authenticator/e7994dbc-2336-4950-91ba-ca22d653759b\">Microsoft Authenticator</a> for Windows Phone</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Best Practices for Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n<p>To benefit from true two-factor authentication, you must keep your token generator and your primary user credentials separate. For example, if you use your mobile device as your token generator, you shouldn&#39;t have your primary user credentials on your mobile device.</p>\n<p>If you decide to use your mobile device as both your token generator and for accessing DNSimple, you still get the added benefit of a one-time password for log in should your credentials be compromised, but you won&#39;t benefit from true two-factor authentication. It&#39;s up to you to decide what level of security is important for you and your accounts.</p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting two-factor authentication {#troubleshooting}</h2>\n<h4>Ensuring your phone&#39;s date and time synchronized</h4>\n<p>Two-factor authentication codes are based on time and thus require the time on your phone to be in-sync with the official time. Otherwise, your authenticator app will generate a mismatching code. If your phone&#39;s time is out of sync, or if you have changed time zones, the best way to fix it is to change the time settings on your phone from &quot;Manual&quot; to &quot;Automatic&quot;.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT203483\">This article from Apple&#39;s help centre will provide steps for iOS</a>.</li>\n<li>Changing this setting on Android may vary, but a <a href=\"https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/5288-update-date-time-on-your-device\">general guide can be found here</a>.</li>\n<li>You can also try the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/2653433\">Time Sync feature if you use Google Authenticator for Android</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Using a freshly-generated authentication code</h4>\n<p>Sometimes, a two-factor authentication code may not be accepted, despite entering it correctly. This most often occurs when the original token was close to expiration.</p>\n<p>The verification code automatically expires every 30 seconds. Most authenticator apps display a count-down with the remaining time before expiration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/2fa-code-expiration.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If the expiration is close to five seconds or less, you should wait for the next verification code to limit the possibility of an authentication failure caused by time differences or connection latency.</p>\n","data":{"title":"Two-Factor Authentication","excerpt":"How to protect your DNSimple account using two-factor authentication.","categories":["Account"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/two-factor-authentication"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>Enforce Two-Factor Authentication for All Members of an Account</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/two-factor-authentication/\">Two-Factor authentication</a> provides an extra level of security to protect your user credentials.

The term <em>gaining registrar</em> refers to the registrar where you want to transfer the domain, the <em>losing registrar</em> is the current registrar for the domain, in this case DNSimple.</p>\n<h2>Before starting</h2>\n<warning>\nOnce a domain transfer is started, you won't be able to change the name servers on the domain. If you want to change your name servers, you must change them before requesting your transfer at your new domain registrar.\n</warning>\n\n<p>To transfer a domain to another registrar, the standard procedure requires you to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unlock the domain at DNSimple.</li>\n<li>Request a transfer code from DNSimple.</li>\n<li>Start the transfer at the gaining registrar.</li>\n<li>Approve the transfer request.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first two steps are handled at DNSimple. The other steps are the responsibility of the gaining registrar. We are unable to provide support for those steps.</p>\n<p>The <em>transfer code</em> (also called <em>authorization code</em>, <em>auth code</em>, or <em>auth info</em>) is required to authorize the transfer of a domain name. The use of a transfer code is a common procedure for most TLDs – including all the gTLDs, such as <code>.COM</code>, <code>.NET</code>, and <code>.ORG</code>.</p>\n<p>Some TLDs have different transfer procedures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/domains-uk/#transfer-away\">.UK TLDs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1. Unlocking the domain and requesting a transfer code</h2>\n<p>You can prepare your domain for transfer out in a single step. This action will unlock the domain and send you the transfer code via email if necessary.</p>\n<p>The transfer code is sent to the email listed as registrant (owner) for the domain. Before proceeding, <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/changing-domain-contact/#updating-a-domain-contact\">check the domain contact and update the email</a> if it doesn&#39;t match an email you have access to.</p>\n<div class=\"section-steps\" markdown=\"1\">\n##### Preparing the domain for transfer out\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Log in to DNSimple with your user credentials.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you have more than one account, select the relevant one.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>On the header, click the <label>Domains</label> tab, locate the relevant domain, and click on the name to access the domain page.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Go to the registration section and click <label>Transfer Out</label></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/domain-transfer-out-action.png\" alt=\"Transfer out link\"></p>\n<p>This will unlock the domain and, if necessary, email the transfer code to the domain registrant.</p>\n</div>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have requested a domain transfer out and have not received a transfer code, please <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/contact\">contact us</a> and include your domain name in the email.

Starting the transfer at the gaining registrar</h2>\n<p>Once you have the transfer code, you need to start the transfer at the gaining registrar. Requesting the transfer code will not automatically initiate a transfer out.</p>\n<p>Follow the gaining registrar&#39;s instructions to start a transfer, and enter the transfer code when requested.</p>\n<p>DNSimple does not have access to this process. Contact the gaining registrar if you need help with this step.</p>\n<h2>3. Approving the transfer request</h2>\n<p>Depending on the TLD, the gaining registrar, the losing registrar, or both may send you an email to confirm the transfer request. Verify that the information in the request is correct (especially the name of the gaining registrar), and confirm the request.</p>\n<p>After the transfer at the new registrar is initiated and the transfer code is provided, the transfer will be initiated at the Registry level. DNSimple has 5 days to release your domain(s) as per <a href=\"https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2012-03-07-en\">ICANN Transfer policy</a>.

Let&#39;s Encrypt has represented a big shift in the certificate authority field in terms of offering, pricing, and automation. Traditionally, certificate authorities have offered yearly certificates. They charged an issuance fee, and the domain validation was generally performed manually via email.</p>\n<p>With the term <em>Standard</em>, we refer to traditional certificate authorities. We expect the difference between traditional authorities and Let&#39;s Encrypt to be reduced in the future. For example, some authorities are already working to expose a more automated validation flow.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s nothing negative about being a &quot;Standard&quot; authority, nor about buying a &quot;Standard&quot; certificate. It&#39;s just a term we use at DNSimple to simplify the workflow.</p>\n<h2>Manage SSL certificates</h2>\n<p>You can purchase and manage SSL certificates from your domain page.

However, we provide a recommendation for a CA that does [here](/articles/can-ev-ssl-certificates).\n</info>\n\n\n<h2>SSL Certificates by Secured Domains</h2>\n<p>An SSL certificate is associated to one or more secured host names that restrict the scope of a certificate.</p>\n<h3>Single-name SSL Certificates</h3>\n<p>Single-name SSL certificates protects a single subdomain (hostname).</p>\n<p>For example, if you purchase a certificate for <code>www.example.com</code> it will not secure <code>mail.example.com</code>.</p>\n<p>On sole discretion of the certificate authority, if you purchase a single-name certificate for the www hostname (<a href=\"http://www.example.com\">www.example.com</a>) the certificate may also include the root domain.</p>\n<info>\nDNSimple provides [single-name certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates).\n</info>\n\n<h3>Wildcard SSL Certificates</h3>\n<p>Wildcard SSL certificates protect an unlimited number of subdomains for a single domain.</p>\n<p>For example, if you purchase a certificate for <code>*.example.com</code> it will secure <code>foo.example.com</code>, <code>bar.example.com</code>, etc. However, it will not secure <code>foo.else.example.com</code>.</p>\n<info>\nDNSimple provides [wildcard certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates).\n</info>\n\n<h3>Multi-Domain SSL Certificates</h3>\n<p>Multi-domain SSL certificates protect different domains with a single certificate, using the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ssl-san\">SAN extension</a>. For this reason, these certificates are often referred to as SAN certificates.</p>\n<p>You can generally secure a combination of different host names, from the same or different domains.</p>\n<info>\nDNSimple provides [multi-domain SAN certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates).\n</info>\n\n\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>It&#39;s important to remember that the validation level and the number of secured domains don&#39;t affect the security level offered by an SSL certificate.</p>\n<p>All certificates work following the same encryption principle.</p>\n","data":{"title":"SSL Certificate Types","excerpt":"This article quickly explains the differences between the various types you may want to use to secure a website.","categories":["SSL Certificates"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-types"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>SSL Certificate email-based Domain Validation</h1>\n<p>In order to issue an SSL certificate, the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-certificate-authority\">Certificate Authority</a> has to validate the authenticity of the certificate order to ensure the request is legitimate and comes from an authorized owner of the domain. This process is called <strong>domain validation</strong>.</p>\n<p>The goal of validation is to ensure the authenticity of a certificate order before issuing a new certificate. Specifically, before issuing the certificate, the Certificate Authority must be sure the domain listed in the certificate is registered and someone with admin rights is aware of and approves the certificate request.</p>\n<p><strong>Email-based domain validation</strong> is the most common certificate validation mechanism for <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-types/#ssl-certificates-by-validation-level\">domain-validated certificate orders</a>. The certificate authority compiles a list of <strong>public emails</strong> associated with the domain, using common administrative emails (e.g. <code>admin</code> or <code>webmaster</code>), in combination with the public WHOIS data for the domain.</p>\n<p>The domain validation is a mandatory step, the Certificate Authority will not issue the certificate if the order has not been validated.</p>\n<note>\nThe Certificate Authority only uses public information, therefore it's not possible to use your account email to perform the validation, unless the email is publicly associated to the domain in the WHOIS record.\n</note>\n\n\n<h2>The process</h2>\n<p>The email validation process consists of a few steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you purchase a certificate, we show you a list of authoritative emails identified by the Certificate Authority for the domain associated with the certificate</li>\n<li>You select an email from the list.</li>\n<li>The Certificate Authority sends a verification email (also called DCV email) to the recipient with a unique link to approve the certificate and validate your domain ownership.</li>\n<li><strong>You click on the link to validate and approve the certificate</strong>. At this point the certificate&#39;s authenticity is validated and the authority will generate it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Email requirements </h2>\n<p><strong>The approval email cannot be an arbitrary email</strong> such as a customer-provided email or the email in your DNSimple account.</p>\n<note>\nThe goal of the validation process is to ensure that the certificate is requested by someone with admin rights on the domain. Therefore, the email must publicly and unequivocally identify the customer as the owner or administrator of the domain listed in the certificate.\n</note>\n\n<p>The approval email typically can be sent to the following addresses, called administrative emails:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:admin@example.com\">admin@example.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:administrator@example.com\">administrator@example.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:hostmaster@example.com\">hostmaster@example.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:postmaster@example.com\">postmaster@example.com</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:webmaster@example.com\">webmaster@example.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where <code>example.com</code> is the domain for the certificate being purchased.</p>\n<h2>Email validation and WHOIS privacy {#whois-privacy}</h2>\n<warning>\n[Whois Privacy Protection services](/articles/what-is-whois-privacy) are known to interfere with the delivery of the approval email. Be sure to temporarily disable the Whois Privacy feature or any another privacy protection service until the certificate is issued.\n</warning>\n\n<p>If the Whois Privacy is enabled for the domain associated with the certificate, the privacy email (e.g. <code>wqyygglqlt@whoisprivacyprotect.com</code>) will be included in the list of possible emails to be used. However, it&#39;s not guaranteed that the delivery will be successful and DNSimple has no control over the delivery of the validation email.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/whois-privacy/#disable-whois-privacy\">Disable any whois privacy</a> service before proceeding.</p>\n<info>\nOnce you disable Whois Privacy it may take up to 24 hours for the email list to be refreshed, as the Certificate Authority may cache that information.\n</info>\n\n\n<h2>Email validation and GDPR {#gdpr}</h2>\n<p>Due to the new privacy rules enacted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a> on May 25th 2018, most registrars are now hiding or masking email addresses in the WHOIS records. This prevents the Certificate Authority from being able to verify you are in control of the domain to issue your certificate.</p>\n<p>As a result, you can no longer use a custom email address listed in the WHOIS to validate a certificate. You will have to use one of the administrative emails provided by the Certification Authority.</p>\n<h2>Select the validation email address {#select-email}</h2>\n<p>You select the validation email when you purchase the certificate.

Selecting the correct names is very important, because the certificate will be valid only if the request matches the host name (or host names) associated with the SSL certificate.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it&#39;s not possible to change the name type of a certificate (e.g. switch from a single-name to a wildcard name) once the certificate has been issued.</p>\n<h2>Single vs Multi names</h2>\n<p>You can associate the host names to an SSL certificate using two different attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-common-name\">Common Name</a></li>\n<li>the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-ssl-san\">Subject Alternative Name</a> (SAN)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Common Name allows specifying a single entry (either a wildcard or single-name), whereas the SAN extension supports multiple entries. However, the SAN is only supported by certain <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates\">SSL certificate products</a>.</p>\n<p>At DNSimple we like to simplify your experience, therefore we hid the technical details and implementation behind a simple interface. We won&#39;t ask you to select when to use the Common Name or the SAN. Instead, whenever you are allowed to enter multiple names for an SSL certificate, you will be provided a field to enter the list of names.</p>\n<p>Additionally, to simplify the interface, we will use the generic term &quot;host names&quot; (sometimes &quot;hostnames&quot; or &quot;domains&quot;) to represent the host names attached to a certificate, regardless of whether they will be attached to the certificate via Common Name or SAN.</p>\n<h2>Single-name vs Wildcard</h2>\n<p>Before you request an SSL certificate you need to understand the difference between a single-name and a wildcard certificate. This is important because it will affect which domains you will be able to cover with a single certificate.</p>\n<h3>Single-name SSL certificate</h3>\n<p>The single name certificate is valid only for the hostname specified with the certificate.</p>\n<p>For example, if you purchase a certificate for the hostname <code>secure.example.com</code>, you can&#39;t use it for <code>www.example.com</code> or <code>example.com</code>. Any attempt to serve these hostnames with the certificate will result in a security warning in most browsers.</p>\n<p>The only exception is the root domain, if you purchase a certificate for the www-hostname, as described below.</p>\n<h3>Wildcard SSL certificate</h3>\n<p>The wildcard certificate is valid only at a single level sub-domain. You use the wildcard &quot;<code>*</code>&quot; symbol to indicate the sub-domain.</p>\n<p>For example, if you purchase a wildcard certificate for <code>*.example.com</code>, you can use it in any <code>example.com</code> first-level subdomain such as <code>www.example.com</code>, <code>secure.example.com</code> or <code>private.example.com</code>. However, you can&#39;t use it for <code>www.secure.example.com</code> or <code>super.secure.example.com</code>.</p>\n<h2>Root domain</h2>\n<p>Both single name and wildcard certificates can be used on the root domain (e.g. <code>example.com</code>) at the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the single name certificate you must purchase a certificate for the www-hostname (e.g. <code>www.example.com</code>). If you purchase a certificate for the root domain you will not be able to use it for the www hostname.</li>\n<li>For the wildcard certificate you must purchase a certificate for the third level domain pattern (e.g. <code>*.example.com</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n","data":{"title":"Choosing the SSL Certificate Names","excerpt":"Guidelines and information for selecting the SSL certificate host names.","categories":["SSL Certificates"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificate-names"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>Certificate Authorities used by DNSimple</h1>\n<p>We provide <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates\">SSL certificates</a> signed by different globally recognized <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-certificate-authority\">certificate authorities</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sectigo.com/\">Sectigo</a> (formerly Comodo) for wildcard and single-name SSL certificates</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a> for single-name, wildcard, and multi-name (SAN) SSL certificates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also used the following certificate authorities in the past:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.rapidssl.com/\">RapidSSL</a> for single-name SSL certificates (until September 11th, 2014)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find the Certificate Authority by inspecting the certificate information in a browser or checking your order in your DNSimple account.</p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/how-to-determine-certificate-authority\">determining the Certificate Authority</a>.</p>\n","data":{"title":"SSL Certificate Authorities used by DNSimple","excerpt":"The list of Certificate Authorities used by DNSimple to sign SSL certificates.","categories":["SSL Certificates"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificate-authorities"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>SRV Records</h1>\n<h2>What&#39;s an SRV record?</h2>\n<p>SRV records help with service discovery. For example, SRV records are used in Internet Telephony to define where a SIP service may be found.</p>\n<p>An SRV record typically defines a symbolic name and the transport protocol used as part of the domain name. It defines the priority, weight, port, and target for the service in the record content.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s an example of two SRV records.</p>\n<pre><code>_sip._tcp.example.com.   3600 IN    SRV 10       60     5060 bigbox.example.com.\n_sip._tcp.example.com.   3600 IN    SRV 10       20     5060 smallbox1.example.com.</code></pre><p>From the name, <code>_sip</code> is the symbolic name for the service and <code>_tcp</code> is the transport protocol.

The first record has a weight of 60 and the second a weight of 20. The priority and weight values can be used to encourage use of certain servers over others.</p>\n<p>The final two values in the record define the port and hostname to connect to for accessing the service.</p>\n<h2>Add an SRV record</h2>\n<p>To add an SRV record in DNSimple, you might fill in the new SRV record form like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/srv-record.png\" alt=\"Add SRV record\"></p>\n<p>This would result in an SRV record like this:</p>\n<pre><code>_sip._tcp.example.com. 3600    IN    SRV    10 20 5000 sip-server.example.com.</code></pre>","data":{"title":"What's an SRV Record?","excerpt":"What an SRV record is, and how to add an SRV record in DNSimple.","categories":["DNS"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/srv-record"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>SPF Records</h1>\n<h2>What&#39;s an SPF record?</h2>\n<p>An SPF record is a Sender Policy Framework record. It&#39;s used to indicate to mail exchanges which hosts are authorized to send mail for a domain. It&#39;s defined in <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4408.txt\">RFC 4408</a>, and clarified by <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7208.txt\">RFC 7208</a>.</p>\n<h2>SPF record format</h2>\n<p>SPF records are typically defined using the TXT record type. There&#39;s also an SPF record type, but it&#39;s deprecated, and you should always have at least the TXT record definition present, even if you use the SPF type.</p>\n<p>SPF records are defined as a single string of text. Here&#39;s an example record:</p>\n<pre><code>v=spf1 a mx ip4:69.64.153.131 include:_spf.google.com ~all</code></pre><p>The SPF record always starts with the <code>v=</code> element. This indicates the SPF version that is used. Right now the version should always be <code>spf1</code> as this is the most common version of SPF that is understood by mail exchanges.</p>\n<p>One or more terms follow the version indicator. These define the rules for which hosts are allowed to send mail from the domain, or provide additional information for processing the SPF record. Terms are made up of mechanisms and modifiers. The following mechanisms are defined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>all</code></li>\n<li><code>include</code></li>\n<li><code>a</code></li>\n<li><code>mx</code></li>\n<li><code>ip4</code></li>\n<li><code>ip6</code></li>\n<li><code>exists</code></li>\n</ul>\n<note>\nThe `ptr` type is also defined but shouldn't be used.\n</note>\n\n<p>There are two modifiers defined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>redirect</code></li>\n<li><code>exp</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>SPF mechanisms</h2>\n<p>The following mechanisms define what IP addresses are allowed to send mail from the domain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>a</code></li>\n<li><code>mx</code></li>\n<li><code>ip4</code></li>\n<li><code>ip6</code></li>\n<li><code>exists</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A mail server will compare the IP address of the sender against the IP addresses defined in the mechanisms. If the IP address matches one of the mechanisms in the SPF record then follow the result handling rule. The default handling rule is <code>+</code> or pass.</p>\n<p>The <code>include</code> mechanism allows you to authorize hosts outside of your administration by specifying their SPF records.</p>\n<p>The <code>all</code> mechanism matches any address. This is usually used as the last mechanism which defines how to handle any sender IP that did not match the previous mechanisms.</p>\n<p>All mechanisms may specify qualifiers for how to handle a match:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>+</code> for pass</li>\n<li><code>-</code> for fail</li>\n<li><code>~</code> for soft fail</li>\n<li><code>?</code> for neutral</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As previously mentioned, the default handling rule is pass, which is the same as the <code>+</code> qualifier.</p>\n<h2>SPF modifiers</h2>\n<p>Modifiers are name/value pairs (separated by an <code>=</code> sign) that provide additional information. Modifiers should appear at the end of the SPF record. A modifier may not appear more than once and unrecognized modifiers are ignored.</p>\n<p>The <code>redirect</code> modifier is used to point to another SPF record to use for processing. This is used when you have multiple domains and want to apply the same SPF content across those multiple domains. Redirects should only be used if you control both domains, otherwise an <code>include</code> is used.</p>\n<p>The <code>exp</code> modifier is used to provide an explanation in case of a <code>-</code> (fail) qualifier is present on a mechanism that is matched.</p>\n<p>Note that we currently do not support modifiers in our SPF editing UI, but you may always add them if you are managing your SPF TXT record directly.</p>\n<h2>SPF record limitations</h2>\n<p><strong>Each fully-qualified name may have at maximum one SPF record</strong>, defined as a TXT record or as an SPF record type.</p>\n<note>\nAlthough the SPF record type is deprecated, it's still supported by DNSimple name servers. In the future we may discontinue serving SPF records, so you should always have a TXT record whose content is the same as the record using the SPF type.\n</note>\n\n<p>There are various limitations on the number of items and lookups permitted in an SPF record:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SPF records may not have more than 10 mechanisms that require DNS lookups. These are the <code>include</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>mx</code>, <code>ptr</code>, and <code>exists</code> mechanisms.</li>\n<li>When evaluating the <code>mx</code> mechanism, the number of MX records queried is included in the overall limit of DNS lookups. Each <code>mx</code> mechanism must not result in querying more than 10 address records.</li>\n<li>The <code>ptr</code> mechanism is also included in the overall limit. Each <code>ptr</code> must not result in querying more than 10 address records.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tips for SPF records</h2>\n<p>Since you may only have one SPF record per fully-qualified name, if you need to add additional modifiers you should add them to your existing SPF record if it&#39;s present.</p>\n<p>SPF records are most often specified on your naked domain name. If you need to exceed the number of modifiers allowed in a single SPF record, you may need to send some of your messages from subdomains below your naked domain. For example, if a third-party SaaS sends mail on your behalf, you may need to send email from <code>something.yourdomain.com</code> for that provider. This is especially true if you have multiple SaaS providers that send email on your behalf.</p>\n<p>If you want to test your SPF records for compliance with the RFCs, you may want to use <a href=\"https://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html\">an online SPF testing tool</a>.</p>\n","data":{"title":"What's an SPF Record?","excerpt":"What an SPF record is, and how the SPF record works.","categories":["DNS"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/spf-record"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>SOA Records</h1>\n<h2>What&#39;s an SOA record?</h2>\n<p>An SOA record is a Start of Authority.

The SHA-2 hashing algorithm, in fact, represents a huge advance in cryptographic security.</p>\n<p>Microsoft announced that on January 1, 2016, they would stop trusting code signing certificates generated with a SHA-1 hashing algorithm, and on January 1, 2017, they would stop trusting SHA-1 generated SSL Certificates.</p>\n<p>On September 5th, 2014, <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.it/2014/09/gradually-sunsetting-sha-1.html\">Google announced plans for gradually sunsetting SHA-1</a> and introduced visual messages in Google Chrome browser to highlight sites with end-entity certificates that expire between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016 and include a SHA-1 based signature as part of the certificate chain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.dnsimple.com/2014/09/sha-2-and-dnsimple/\">This announcement has brought renewed attention</a> to the subject of SSL certificates and their security.</p>\n<h2>How does this affect me?</h2>\n<p>We decided to provide this support page to educate our customers on the subject.

The IP address on that node is 50.31.225.92. Please prefer the host name whenever possible. If the IP address should change, we&#39;ll inform you in advance using your account email.</p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<div class=\"section-faq\" markdown=\"1\">\n1.  #### What is Secondary DNS and why do I want it?\n\n<pre><code>Secondary DNS is when you use a special protocol called AXFR to automatically transfer your zones to a secondary DNS provider whenever they change. This allows you to use DNSimple&#39;s nameservers and another DNS provider&#39;s nameservers at the same time.\n\nThis lets you have an active redundancy in your domain name resolution. If an issue came up with DNSimple, you&#39;d still have active resolution with your other provider. This disaster prevention is very valuable to any products that need high uptime. When secondary DNS is enabled, those nameservers may be used at any time by resolvers – not just when an issue arises resolving names through our nameservers.</code></pre><ol>\n<li><h4>Can DNSimple serve as a secondary DNS provider?</h4>\n<p>DNSimple can&#39;t synchronize zone changes from other name servers using AXFR. But you can combine our secondary DNS feature with our API or UI to have zone redundancy with other DNS providers. See <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/secondary-dnsimple\">DNSimple as a Secondary DNS provider</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><h4>How can I check that my secondary DNS configuration is correct?</h4>\n<p>If you&#39;re using one of the secondary DNS providers for which we provide prepared configuration, please <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/contact\">let us know</a> if you experience trouble. Otherwise, you should be able to find the proper values in your provider&#39;s documentation. You should also be able to test the configuration on their end.</p>\n</li>\n<li><h4>How can I test that secondary DNS is working?</h4>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve added the proper configuration and verified with your secondary provider that they can make AXFR queries and receive zone transfers, you should be able to query one or all of the secondary name servers with <code>dig</code> by pointing it at the secondary name servers. If you wanted to check the resolution for <code>yourdomain.com</code>, and had added <code>ns5.dnsmadeeasy.com</code> as a secondary DNS server, you could execute <code>dig @ns5.dnsmadeeasy.com yourdomain.com</code> to check the records you set with DNSimple on the apex domain. If there&#39;s any difference between the response and what you get from DNSimple, something is likely misconfigured.</p>\n</li>\n<li><h4>Is the order of the name servers relevant?</h4>\n<p>No. The order of name servers in your registrar, whois record, NS record set, or secondary DNS configuration doesn&#39;t matter. Resolvers will make requests against the name servers in your whois record by randomly selecting one or multiple name servers provided.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","data":{"title":"Secondary DNS","excerpt":"This page provides information about secondary DNS configuration with DNSimple.","categories":["Secondary DNS"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/secondary-dns"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>Secondary DNS Configuration with EasyDNS</h1>\n<p>For an overview of SecondaryDNS, have a look at <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/secondary-dns\">our introduction article</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>An active account with <strong>EasyDNS</strong>.

Another use case is to redirect a secondary domain you purchased to the main domain without pointing it to any web hosting service.</p>\n<p>This feature can&#39;t be used to redirect from one protocol to another protocol on the same host name. For example, you can&#39;t use it to redirect from <code>http://example.com</code> to <code>https://example.com</code>.

The code is not configurable, and it&#39;s not possible to return a 302 temporary redirect using the <code>URL</code> record.</p>\n<h2>HTTPS redirects</h2>\n<p>The DNSimple redirector supports HTTPS redirects. In order to enable it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/url-record\"><code>URL</code> record</a> to your domain</li>\n<li>Issue an <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates\">SSL Certificate</a> for the same domain</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Incoming HTTPS requests will be handled automatically with that SSL certificate:</p>\n<pre><code>https://source.com =&gt; http://destination.com\nhttps://source.com =&gt; https://destination.com</code></pre><h2>URL to URL redirects</h2>\n<p>URL to URL redirects can&#39;t be done with our <code>URL</code> record. Only domains or subdomains can be redirected to complete URLs.</p>\n<p>The following redirect will not work, because you can&#39;t add a URL to the name part of the <code>URL</code> record.</p>\n<pre><code>foo.com/blog/ to bar.com/blog</code></pre><p>This would work, because you can add a <code>URL</code> record for blog.foo.com:</p>\n<pre><code>blog.foo.com to bar.com/blog</code></pre><p>Any path or query information passed by the user is passed to the resulting URL. If you set up a redirect from blog.foo.com to myfooblog.com, when the user goes to blog.foo.com/awesome_article they&#39;ll be redirected to myfooblog.com/awesome_article.</p>\n<h2>Wildcard URL redirects</h2>\n<p>You can configure a wildcard redirect using the same conventions of a DNS wildcard record. However, the target can&#39;t contain any wildcard references.</p>\n<pre><code># Valid redirects\n*.foo.com to bar.com\n*.foo.com to bar.com/path\n\n# This will redirect to the hostname\n*.foo.com to *.bar.com</code></pre><p>The wildcard pattern can only be on the left outermost level.</p>\n<pre><code># Valid redirects\n*.foo.com to bar.com\n\n# Invalid redirects\nfoo.*.bar.com to baz.com</code></pre><h2>Match-based URL redirects</h2>\n<p>The redirector doesn&#39;t support redirect targets that include a back-reference (match) to the redirect source.

They&#39;re typically more expensive than a normal domain, with prices going into the thousands of dollars in some cases. An example of a gTLD is <code>.love</code> or <code>.ninja</code>.</p>\n<h2>What makes a Premium Domain valuable</h2>\n<p>Premium domains appeal to specific businesses or groups of people, providing them with useful, specific domain names for their activities. Other times they&#39;re just popular keywords or a very well known combination of a name and domain. Some registries or registrars also consider two or three letter domains to be more valuable, so those may have a higher price.</p>\n<p>For example: Paris is known as the city of love. The domain created as a combination of these could be <code>paris.love</code> and would be an attractive name for marketing companies or businesses. The <code>.love</code> registry may impose a higher fee for this combination. The registrar may even make it more expensive than a typical <code>.love</code> domain registration.</p>\n<h2>How can I register or transfer a Premium Domain with DNSimple?</h2>\n<p>When going through our domain registration process, if you try to register a domain flagged as a premium pricing domain, you&#39;ll see an alert indicating the new price versus the typical price for that domain.

With the release of the multi-account feature, we also changed our plan structure.</p>\n<p>This article explains the main differences between the pre-2015 plans and current plans.</p>\n<h2>Legacy plans</h2>\n<p>Before the current plans, we had two generations of domain-based plans. They shared the same names, but were priced differently.</p>\n<p>First-generation legacy plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bronze v1</li>\n<li>Silver v1</li>\n<li>Gold v1</li>\n<li>Platinum v1</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Second-generation legacy plans (introduced in 2014):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bronze</li>\n<li>Silver</li>\n<li>Gold</li>\n<li>Platinum</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Current plans</h2>\n<p>Current plans are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal</li>\n<li>Professional</li>\n<li>Business</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also have reseller plans for customers that plan to manage 100 domains or more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Expert Reseller</li>\n<li>Master Reseller</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Identify the plan type</h2>\n<p>You can check your plan type from your account page. It&#39;s immediately visible on the main account page – just select the account you want to check. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/account-plan-info.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you&#39;re using a legacy plan, a yellow banner will appear at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/account-plan-legacy.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You can click on <label>learn more</label> to get additional information about current plans and how to upgrade.</p>\n<h2>Current plans vs Legacy plans</h2>\n<p>The main difference between legacy plans and current plans is the structure. With legacy plans, we charged you based on how many domains you had in your account. Now, <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/pricing\">our plans</a> are based on the features you need. </p>\n<p>The Personal plan is our most affordable offering, and includes the features necessary for a single person. The Professional and Business plans include features organizations commonly request, like multi-user accounts and the ability to configure different billing addresses.</p>\n<p>Plans no longer have domain limits. So even if you have more domains than average on the Personal plan, you won&#39;t have to upgrade to a more expensive plan just to add more. You can stay on the plan that has the features you need, and add as many domains you want.</p>\n<p>Each plan includes five domains. We charge a small fee per domain for extra domains, based on the plan. If you have a substantial number of domains, you should consider one of our <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/reseller\">reseller plans</a>. Reseller plans have a higher monthly cost compared to standard plans, but they have a larger discount on the price-per-domain.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ve written a few articles to clarify the difference between old plans and current plans:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/new-plans-for-bronze\">I&#39;m a Bronze customer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/new-plans-for-silver\">I&#39;m a Silver customer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/new-plans-for-gold\">I&#39;m a Gold customer</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Price differences</h2>\n<p>In most cases, the price for current plans is similar to the price of second-generation legacy plans. Depending on the number of domains in your account, current plans may even be less expensive.</p>\n<p>Compared to first-generation legacy plans, some customers may notice a larger price increase (especially Gold v1). We introduced first-generation plans in 2010 when DNSimple&#39;s infrastructure was simpler and less expensive to maintain.</p>\n<p>Over the last six years we&#39;ve invested heavily in DDoS protection, Anycast DNS, and additional infrastructure.  We continue working to provide advanced features, like easy-to-use SSL certificates and Secondary DNS. Our current plans improve the service for all our customers, and help DNSimple grow .</p>\n<h2>Features only on current plans </h2>\n<p>Many features are only made available on <a href=\"#newer-plans\">current plans</a>: Personal, Professional, Business, and Reseller plans.</p>\n<p>If you see a <em>newer plan warning</em> banner at the top of a support article, it means your account must be subscribed to one of the current plans in order to use the feature. If you&#39;re using a legacy plan, such as Bronze, Silver, or Gold, you can upgrade to the appropriate plan, and the feature will immediately be available to you.</p>\n<h2>Features only on certain tiers of current plans {#newer-plans-some}</h2>\n<p>Some features are only available on certain plans, based on the level of service. For example, teams and regional records are features that make sense in an organizational context, so they&#39;re only available on Professional and Business plans.</p>\n<p>If you see a <em>some-plans warning</em> banner at the top of a support article, make sure your account is subscribed to the correct plan for that feature.</p>\n<p>Some advanced features are only available in higher-tier plans. If you need the feature on a limited number of domains, you may want to <a href=\"https://blog.dnsimple.com/2015/12/using-accounts-to-segment-business/\">use multiple accounts to segment the business</a>.</p>\n<p>For example, if you need <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/vanity-nameservers\">vanity name servers</a> only on 3-4 domains, create a separate account with these domains, and subscribe  it to the Business plan. Leave the other domains on a lower plan, such as Professional, and you&#39;ll only pay the for the feature on domains where you actually use it.</p>\n","data":{"title":"Current Plans and Legacy Plans","excerpt":"This article explains the main differences between pre-2015 plans and current plans.","categories":["Account"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/new-plans"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>I&#39;m a Silver customer.

MX Records tell email delivery agents where they should deliver your email. You can have many MX records for a domain.

When you create a Google Apps account and you want your email to be delivered to your Google Apps mail account, Google provides a set of MX records you need to add to DNSimple. Here are the default MX records Google suggests:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aspmx.l.google.com 1</li>\n<li>alt1.aspmx.l.google.com 5</li>\n<li>alt2.aspmx.l.google.com 5</li>\n<li>aspmx2.googlemail.com 10</li>\n<li>aspmx3.googlemail.com 10</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google provides you with 5 different servers that can accept your email. Each MX record includes a priority value, which is a relative value compared to the other priorities of MX records for your domain. Addresses with lower values will be used first. Therefore, when a mail agent wants to deliver an email to you, it would first attempt to deliver to <code>aspmx.l.google.com</code>. If that server can&#39;t handle the delivery, it would move onto <code>alt1.aspmx.l.google.com</code>. If that server can&#39;t handle the delivery, it would move onto <code>alt2.aspmx.l.google.com</code>, and so on.</p>\n<p>MX records make it easy to define what servers should handle email delivery.

If you have another record on that subdomain, you can&#39;t add a CNAME, as that CNAME would render the other records useless. Let&#39;s look at an example:</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s assume there&#39;s an MX record on email.example.com, and you try to add a CNAME on that exact subdomain (email.example.com). If you added the CNAME, it would override the subdomain (email.example.com) and render the MX record useless, leading to a lot of potential confusion when email stops. To counter this potential confusion, the domain name system doesn&#39;t allow other records alongside a CNAME.</p>\n<p>You can achive a similar behavior as a CNAME with a ALIAS record. If you want a sub-domain to always resolve to the IP address of another domain, you can use a ALIAS record pointing to that domain.

The 3 most distinguishing characteristics, as listed on their homepage, are <em>free</em>, <em>automated</em>, and <em>open</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free: Let&#39;s Encrypt SSL certificates are free. They don&#39;t charge per certificate.</li>\n<li>Automated: Let&#39;s Encrypt issuance process is fully automated. They developed a new issuance protocol called <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/acme-protocol-updates/\">ACME</a> that&#39;s designed to be fully automated with no manual intervention.</li>\n<li>Open: The source code of Let&#39;s Encrypt certification authority is completely open source and available in a <a href=\"https://github.com/letsencrypt\">GitHub account</a>. This is by far the most unique characteristic of this CA.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Differences between Let&#39;s Encrypt and Standard SSL certificates</h2>\n<p>The table below summarizes the most important differences between Let&#39;s Encrypt and Standard SSL certificates.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Let&#39;s Encrypt</th>\n<th>Standard</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td>Certificate Expiration</td>\n<td>90 days</td>\n<td>Multi-year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Single names</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wildcard names</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multi-domain (via SAN)</td>\n<td>Supported by default</td>\n<td>Supported only by specific products</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max SAN domains</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>Depends on the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-certificate-authority\">CA</a> and product</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-types/#ssl-certificates-by-validation-level\">Validation type</a></td>\n<td><acronym title=\"Domain Validated\">DV</acronym> only</td>\n<td><acronym title=\"Domain Validated\">DV</acronym>, <acronym title=\"Organization Validated (not supported by DNSimple)\">OV</acronym>, <acronym title=\"Extended Validation (not supported by DNSimple)\">EV</acronym></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost</td>\n<td>Free</td>\n<td>Depends on the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-certificate-authority\">CA</a> and product</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Limits</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/\">Per-domain, Per-week limits</a></td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2>Let&#39;s Encrypt highlights</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s Encrypt is different from most traditional certificate authorities. Here are a few relevant notes and limitations you may want to keep in mind before requesting one of their SSL certificates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Let&#39;s Encrypt only issues <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-types/\">domain-validated</a> SSL certificates. There&#39;s no plan to support <acronym title=\"Organization Validated\">OV</acronym> or <acronym title=\"Extended Validation\">EV</acronym> certificates.</li>\n<li>Let&#39;s Encrypt supports both single-name and wildcard names.</li>\n<li>A single Let&#39;s Encrypt certificate can include up to 100 SAN names. Names can be single-name, wildcard names, or both.</li>\n<li>Let&#39;s Encrypt certificates have a fixed expiration period of 90 days. It&#39;s not possible to request a certificate with a longer expiration, so it&#39;s not possible to obtain 1-year or <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/can-multi-year-ssl-certificates\">multi-year</a> SSL certificates.</li>\n<li>Although Let&#39;s Encrypt is a new authority, their SSL certificates are <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificate-compatibility/\">compatible with major browsers</a> and <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs.html\">trusted by all major root programs</a>.</li>\n<li>Let&#39;s Encrypt certificates are domain-validated. The most common validation mechanisms are DNS-based and HTTP-based. They don&#39;t support traditional <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-email-validation\">email-based validation</a>.</li>\n<li>Let&#39;s Encrypt <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/\">rate-limits</a> requests. Make sure you understand their limits before requesting a large number of certificates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that some Let&#39;s Encrypt features may not be supported by DNSimple. Check the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/letsencrypt/#limitations\">limitations</a> section to learn which features are supported.</p>\n<h2>Integration</h2>\n<p>The DNSimple Let&#39;s Encrypt integration allows you to request an SSL certificate for free using the Let&#39;s Encrypt certification authority.</p>\n<note>\nIn order to request an SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt, the domains **must be delegated and resolving with DNSimple**. The domain doesn't need to be registered with DNSimple.\n</note>\n\n<p>The certificate validation is completely automated using a DNS challenge. Once issued, you&#39;ll receive an email and <a href=\"https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/webhooks/\">webhook notification</a>. The certificate will then be available to download from your DNSimple account.</p>\n<p>The certificate expiration is 90 days. If auto-renewal is enabled, the certificate will automatically renew before the expiration. If a new validation is necessary, we&#39;ll automatically re-validate the domain via DNS. Once renewed, you&#39;ll receive an email and webhook notification. You&#39;ll still need to install the newly issued certificate once renewed.</p>\n<p>As suggested by Let&#39;s Encrypt, the renewal will happen any time after 60 days (30 days before expiration).</p>\n<tip>\nAlthough Let's Encrypt certificates can be installed manually, the entire process is designed to be fully automated. We encourage you to use our [certificate API](https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/certificates/) to fetch the certificate and install it programmatically.\n</tip>\n\n\n<h2>Products</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s Encrypt provides only one type of certificate. They issue only domain-validated, SAN certificates, and support both single-name and wildcard names.</p>\n<p>Single-name certificates can be considered a special type of multi-name certificate with a single name associated with it.  Let&#39;s Encrypt offering is both multi-name and single-name.</p>\n<info>\nThe ability to customize names associated with a Let's Encrypt certificate depends on the plan you're subscribed to. Check the [plans and pricing page](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) to view all your options.\n</info>\n\n\n<h2>DNSimple Limitations</h2>\n<p>Note that DNSimple doesn&#39;t support all Let&#39;s Encrypt features. Some features will be incrementally introduced in the future, while others are not supported due to design decisions or limitations imposed by our system.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We only support DNS-based validation. We don&#39;t plan to support the HTTP or TLS-SNI challenges.</li>\n<li>We don&#39;t support the ability to include names from different domains in the same certificate SAN. We only support same-domain names (subdomains).</li>\n<li>We don&#39;t support custom CSR or private key while requesting a new certificate. The CSR will be generated by DNSimple based on the domains specified in the certificate order.</li>\n<li>In order to use our Let&#39;s Encrypt integration, the domain must be resolving with us, as we&#39;ll automatically create the DNS records required for the validation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>DNSimple plan-specific features</h2>\n<p>Let&#39;s Encrypt feature support varies based on your <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/pricing\">DNSimple subscription plan</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can request as many certificates as you want, as long as you stay within Let&#39;s Encrypt <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/\">rate limits</a>.</li>\n<li>Depending on your plan, you can specify your custom subdomains, or they&#39;ll default to www/root domain. View our <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/pricing\">plans and pricing page</a> to check which plans support certificates with subdomains.</li>\n<li>Depending on your plan, you can customize the certificate SAN with up to 100 extra names for a single certificate. View our <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/pricing\">plans and pricing page</a> to check which plans support certificates with SAN.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Testing</h2>\n<p>We don&#39;t support Let&#39;s Encrypt in our <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/sandbox\">sandbox environment</a>. We discourage the use of the production environment for heavy or automated testing purposes, as you may quickly hit Let&#39;s Encrypt <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/\">rate limits</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have specific testing needs, you may want to consider using the Let&#39;s Encrypt <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/\">staging environment</a>.</p>\n<h2>Order certificate</h2>\n<p>To order a new certificate via Let&#39;s Encrypt using DNSimple, follow the instructions in the article <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ordering-lets-encrypt-certificate\">Ordering a Let&#39;s Encrypt SSL certificate</a>.</p>\n<p>If you already have a certificate and you want to renew it, follow the instructions for <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/renewing-ssl-certificate/\">Renewing an SSL certificate</a>. We also support <a href=\"#auto-renewal\">auto-renewals for Let&#39;s Encrypt certificates</a>.</p>\n<h2>Auto-renewal </h2>\n<p>DNSimple supports auto-renewals for Let&#39;s Encrypt certificates. When the auto-renewal feature is turned on, we&#39;ll automatically renew the certificate before expiration.</p>\n<p>Once renewed, you&#39;ll receive an email and <a href=\"https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/webhooks/\">webhook notification</a>. The certificate will then be available to download from your DNSimple account.</p>\n<info>\nLet's Encrypt certificates are automatically renewed **30 days before the expiration date**, as suggested by Let's Encrypt, with automatic failover attempts every day in case of temporary failures.\n</info>\n\n<p>The feature is available for free to all accounts.

This process is called <strong>domain validation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Email-based domain validation is the most common certificate validation mechanism for domain-validated certificate orders.</p>\n<p>This article explains how to use a different email for validating your SSL certificate order, in case your email is not visible in the list generated by the Certificate Authority.</p>\n<info>\nIf you are not familiar with the email validation process, please read the [email validation](/articles/ssl-certificates-email-validation) article before proceeding to the next section.\n</info>\n\n\n<h2>What email can I use?</h2>\n<p><strong>The approval email cannot be an arbitrary email</strong> such as a customer-provided email or the email in your DNSimple account.</p>\n<note>\nRemember: the goal of the validation process is to ensure that the certificate is requested by someone with admin rights on the domain. Therefore, the email must publicly and inequivocally identify the customer as the owner or administrator of the domain listed in the certificate.\n</note>\n\n<p>The approval email typically can be sent to the following addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a generic administrative email, such as <code>admin@example.com</code>, <code>webmaster@example.com</code> (see <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-email-validation/#requirements\">email requirements for domain validation</a> for the full list)</li>\n<li>the email address listed in the public WHOIS record for the domain</li>\n</ul>\n<warning>\nThere are no other alternatives. You can't use your account email or any other email, unless this is visible in the public WHOIS record for the domain. \n</warning>\n\n\n<h2>Select a different validation email address </h2>\n<note>\nBefore proceeding, **take a moment to read the [email requirements for domain validation](/articles/ssl-certificates-email-validation/#requirements) to understand the goal of the certificate validation and how it works**. It's important to remember that, as described above in this article, the list of authoritative emails is generated by the Certificate Authority based on the email addresses publicly associated with the domain attached to the certificate.\n</note>\n\n<p>If you want to submit your certificate to the Certificate Authority for approval but none of the provided email addresses are working, then you have a few options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Temporarily configure one of the email addresses in the list (either as a full mailbox or as an alias/forward to an existing mailbox). If the domain doesn&#39;t have any email service associated and you manage the DNS with us, you can use our <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/email-forwarding\">email forwarding</a> service to quickly create an email for <code>admin@example.com</code> and forward it to a personal or private email.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want to use the email associated with the domain, but it is not visible, make sure you have the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-email-validation/#whois-privacy\">whois privacy temporarily turned off</a> for the domain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want to use the email associated with the domain, the whois privacy is off but the email is still not visible, <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/whois\">run a WHOIS query for the domain</a> and make sure the email is visible in the WHOIS record. If it&#39;s not, then you cannot use that email.</p>\n<note>\nSome registries (such as the .IO, .UK, .BR) do not disclose registrant email therefore it's not possible to select the registrant email for a certificate purchased for one of these TLDs. In this case, you will have to use one of the other solutions above.\n</note>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want to use a different email address either from the same domain or a different one, update the WHOIS record for the domain to include the email address in at least one of the WHOIS contact (e.g. registrant/owner, technical contact or admin contact).

This prevents the Certificate Authority from being able to verify you are in control of the domain to issue your certificate.</p>\n<p>As a result, you can no longer use a custom email address listed in the WHOIS to validate a certificate if the registrar/registry doesn&#39;t disclose the contact information.</p>\n</note>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","data":{"title":"How can I select a different SSL certificate domain validation email?","excerpt":"This article explains how to use a different email for validating the SSL certificate.","categories":["SSL Certificates"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/how-to-different-ssl-domain-validation-email"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>How do I determine the Certificate Authority that signed my SSL certificate?</h1>\n<h2>Certificate from DNSimple</h2>\n<p>When you request an SSL certificate with DNSimple, the certificate authority information are clearly visible in your SSL certificate page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/ssl-authority-order.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Once the SSL certificate is issued, we also extract the identification of the Issuer (the Certificate Authority) from the certificate, and we display it in the certificate page:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/ssl-authority-certificate.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you can&#39;t access your SSL certificate page, or you didn&#39;t request the certificate using DNSimple, then use the following generic procedure to determine the certificate authority.</p>\n<h2>Generic procedure</h2>\n<p>To determine the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/what-is-certificate-authority\">Certificate Authority</a> that issued your certificate, open the website in a browser and click on the certificate information.</p>\n<p>The steps to view the certificate information depend on the browser.

Before that date it was only possible to register a <code>.UK</code> domain under one of the available suffixes (e.g. <code>.CO.UK</code>, <code>.ORG.UK</code>), not at the top level domain.</p>\n<p>Because of that, domain name registrations at the second level in <code>.UK</code> name registrations are ruled by a <a href=\"http://registrars.nominet.org.uk/sites/default/files/sldr_rules_140507_final_0.pdf\">strict reservation policy</a>. In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if a domain name with a <code>.CO.UK</code> (or similar extension) was registered before than October 28th, 2013, the corresponding .UK domain name is reserved for 5 years to the existing owner. If more than one qualifying 3rd level .UK domains existed before that date, the precedence will always be given to <code>.CO.UK</code>, then <code>.ORG.UK</code> (<a href=\"http://registrars.nominet.org.uk/sites/default/files/sldr_rules_140507_final_0.pdf\">learn more</a>)</li>\n<li>if no qualifying 3rd level <code>.UK</code> domain existed before that date, then after June 10th, 2014 the <code>.UK</code> domain name will be available on a first-come-first-served basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>.CO.UK</code> domain owners have the right to register the associated <code>.UK</code> domain within a 5 years period. If a <code>.UK</code> is registered and then cancelled prior to these 5 years, the initial owner will lose the right for its re-registration.</p>\n<h2>Registering a .UK domain {#register}</h2>\n<p>Because of the <a href=\"#policy-tld\">reservation policy</a>, registering a .UK domain requires some extra diligence. Assuming you have the right to register a <code>.UK</code> domain, you will need to use the same registration information (specifically the contact information) you used to register the corresponding <code>.CO.UK</code> or <code>.ORG.UK</code> domain.</p>\n<warning>\nProviding a different contact information will [cause the domain registration to fail](#account-name-registrant-no-rights). To minimize the risk of registration errors, contact information must be identical, including registrant name, company name, email and phone numbers. Spaces, symbols or different string case (e.g. camelcase vs lowercase) may also cause the registration to fail.\n</warning>\n\n<p>If the corresponding domain is registered with DNSimple, the <code>.UK</code> domain name registration may be slightly easier.</p>\n<h3>The corresponding domain is registered with DNSimple</h3>\n<p>If the corrisponding domain is already registered with DNSimple, the <code>.UK</code> domain name registration is easier. In fact, in DNSimple you are required to associate each domain with a contact record. To register the <code>.UK</code> domain, simply associate the same contact (do not create a new one!) you already used for the previous domain registration, and we will send to the registry the same contact details.</p>\n<p>This will drastically reduce the risk that your <code>.UK</code> domain registration is rejected because of registrant validation errors.</p>\n<h3>The corresponding domain is not registered with DNSimple</h3>\n<p>If the corresponding domain is not registered with DNSimple, then you need to login into the control panel of your current registrar and copy/paste the current contact information into a new contact in DNSimple (or update the DNSimple contact you want to use).</p>\n<p>Use this contact when registering the new <code>.UK</code> domain.</p>\n<note>\n#### Compare the contact information\n\n<p>We noticed that several <code>.UK</code> domain name registrations failed because users manually entered their contact information into DNSimple, either assuming they remembered them or did not correctly copy the contact information from the existing 3rd level domain name.</p>\n<p>Please make sure the information of the contact in DNSimple matches the information at the current 3rd level domain registrar. Use copy and paste to avoid typos and spelling errors.\n</note></p>\n<tip>\nInstead of creating a new contact in DNSimple, it's perfectly fine to reuse an existing contact, as long as you change the contact information to match the ones copied from your current 3rd level .UK domain **before** registering the `.UK`. Please note that changing the contact information of an existing contact will cause all the domains associated with it to be updated with the new contact details at the registry.\n</tip>\n\n<h2>Transferring a .UK domain to DNSimple {#transfer}</h2>\n<p>To transfer a UK domain (i.e. example.uk or example.co.uk) into DNSimple, follow <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/transferring-uk-domain\">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h2>Transferring a .UK domain away from DNSimple {#transfer-away}</h2>\n<p>To transfer a UK domain away from DNSimple, the procedure is similar to the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/transferring-uk-domain\">instructions to transfer in</a>, but you will need to get the IPS tag of the gaining registrar.</p>\n<h2>Updating the registrant name</h2>\n<p>It is possible to change most values in the Whois record for a UK domain, but the registrant name should generally be changed through Nominet&#39;s Online Services (Nominet is the Registry for UK domains). It is possible to <a href=\"https://secure.nominet.org.uk/auth/login.html\">register for Nominet Online Services</a> with the email address you have in your registrant information and update the value for the registrant name with them.

A WHOIS query usually returns information such as the person or organization that registered the domain, the expiration date, and the domain registrar.</p>\n<p>WHOIS queries are useful to identify ownership of a domain. However, spammers take advantage of this public information to call and spam you with text messages. This is why most domain registrar provide WHOIS privacy.

DS records MUST be updated whenever DNSSEC keys are rotated in your DNSimple zone. If you don&#39;t update your DS record when your keys change, your domain will fail to resolve through resolvers that verify DNSSEC keys, including Google&#39;s Public DNS. This will result in failed DNS resolution for your domains.\n</warning></p>\n<p>During the key rotation, old and new keys are attached to your zone for 7 days (the duration of the key rotation period). At the end of the rotation period, our system removes the old key, leaving only the new key in place.</p>\n<h3>Automating key rotation</h3>\n<p>If your domain registrar provides an API for managing DS records, you can automate rotation for domains registered outside DNSimple. To do this, use the <code>dnssec.rotation_start</code> and <code>dnssec.rotation_complete</code> webhook events. You can find more information in <a href=\"https://developer.dnsimple.com/v2/webhooks/\">our developer documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>CDS/CDNSKEY</h2>\n<p>CDS and CDNSKEY are two record types that can be used to automatically provision and deprovision DS records at parent name servers. The parent name server provider must support CDS and/or CDNSKEY for these records to be used to automatically provision and deprovision DS records.</p>\n<p>CDS and CDNSKEY record types are automatically generated for all DNSimple zones signed after January 1st, 2019, and for all new DNSSEC DNSKEY records created after January 1st, 2019. CDS and CDNSKEY records are managed by DNSimple. These records are not meant to be added or removed manually.</p>\n<p>You can find details about how CDS/CDNSKEY work in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8078\">RFC 8078</a>.</p>\n<h2>Troubleshooting DNSSEC configurations</h2>\n<p>These tools are helpful for troubleshooting DNSSEC configuration issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/\">Verisign DNSSEC Debugger</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://dnsviz.net/\">DNSViz</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/contact\">contact DNSimple support</a> with additional questions.</p>\n<h3>DS records without a corresponding DNSKEY</h3>\n<p>When a DS record is present at your domain registrar, but there&#39;s no corresponding DNSKEY in your zone, DNSSEC-aware resolvers will fail to resolve your domain. For example, with Google Public DNS this will result in a SERVFAIL. Clients using a non-DNSSEC-aware resolver will still be able to resolve your domain.</p>\n<p>To fix this issue, remove the DS record from your registrar. This won&#39;t immediately fix resolution for some clients, as they&#39;ll see the cached DS record. DS record time-to-live values are set by domain registries and may be set to values of 12 hours or more.</p>\n","data":{"title":"DNSSEC","excerpt":"DNSimple provides full support for DNSSEC in our authoritative name servers, including signing of zones registered outside DNSimple.","categories":["DNS"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/dnssec"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>Contacting DNSimple Support</h1>\n<p>Get in touch:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the online <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/contact\">contact form</a></li>\n<li>Drop us a line at <a href=\"mailto:support@dnsimple.com\">support@dnsimple.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Priority support</h2>\n<p>If you have a Business subscription, you have priority support and a dedicated queue for faster responses. </p>\n<p>To send a priority support email, fill out the <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/contact\">contact form</a> while logged in to your business account.</p>\n<h2>Get faster, more accurate responses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Send requests using the email associated with your account. </li>\n<li>If you send us an email from an address not associated with your account, mention your account email address in the message.</li>\n<li>Include the domain name(s) you&#39;re inquiring about.</li>\n<li>Include the full domain name when inquiring about a certificate.</li>\n<li>When reporting an error, include the steps you took prior to receiving the error message.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Typical response times</h2>\n<p>Monday - Friday: You should receive a response within 24 hours - but it&#39;s often sooner. </p>\n<p>Response times may be slower on weekends.</p>\n<h2>Phone support</h2>\n<p>We do not offer phone support.</p>\n<h2>Twitter</h2>\n<p>If you&#39;d like to chat, say thanks, or share the love, give us a shout <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dnsimple\">@dnsimple</a> on Twitter.

It provides a way to validate that an organization delivering an email has the right to do so.</p>\n<h2>Setting up DKIM</h2>\n<p>DKIM requires the addition of public keys into your DNS zone. The key is often provided to you by the organization that is sending your email, for example <a href=\"https://sendgrid.com/docs/Glossary/dkim.html\">SendGrid</a>, <a href=\"http://support.postmarkapp.com/customer/portal/articles/64739-what-is-dkim-\">Postmark</a>, or <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en\">Google Apps</a>. The key will either be inserted directly into your zone as a TXT record, or it will be a CNAME pointing to the key in your provider&#39;s DNS.</p>\n<p>If you&#39;re given a string representing the DKIM, it usually looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>k=rsa; t=s; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDGMjj8MVaESl30KSPYdLaEreSYzvOVh15u9YKAmTLgk1ecr4BCRq3Vkg3Xa2QrEQWbIvQj9FNqBYOr3XIczzU8gkK5Kh42P4C3DgNiBvlNNk2BlA5ITN/EvVAn/ImjoGq5IrcO+hAj2iSAozYTEpJAKe0NTrj49CIkj5JI6ibyJwIDAQAB</code></pre><p>Insert this into a TXT record. Do this by following the instructions for <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/record-editor/#create-a-record\">creating a record</a>, selecting TXT as the record type, and entering the string you were given into the Content field.</p>\n<p>Your provider will also give you a specific subdomain to use, usually something like:</p>\n<pre><code>something._domainkey</code></pre><p>Enter this subdomain in the &quot;Name&quot; field.</p>\n<p>If your provider gives you a fully-qualified name that ends with your domain name, DO NOT include your domain name in the &quot;Name&quot; field when you add the TXT record. If you&#39;re given <code>pm._domainkey.yourdomain.com</code>, only enter <code>pm._domainkey</code> in the &quot;Name&quot; field.</p>\n<h2>Quotes and slashes?</h2>\n<p>If your provider gave you the DKIM record and it included double quotes around the record, or backslashes before semi-colons in the record, you may safely remove them. The quotes are handled automatically by our name servers, and the semi-colons will automatically be escaped if necessary.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there will be forward slashes or other unusual characters in the DKIM record. Don&#39;t modify those. If you have any questions or concerns, <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/contact\">contact support</a>.</p>\n<h2>Verifying your DKIM with dig</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/how-dig/\">dig</a> tool is a good way to verify that your DKIM record is being returned correctly by our DNS servers.</p>\n<p>To verify the DKIM record, query for the TXT record at the fully qualified domain name where the TXT record lives. For example, on the domain aetrion.com, you can get the TXT record using the following query:</p>\n<pre><code>dig +short google._domainkey.aetrion.com TXT</code></pre><p>This will return a result like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;v=DKIM1\\; k=rsa\\; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC3QEKyU1fSma0axspqYK5iAj+54lsAg4qRRCnpKK68hawSd8zpsDz77ntGCR0X2mHVvkf0WEOIqaspaG/A5IGxieiWer+wBX8lW2tE4NHTE0PLhHqL0uD2sif2pKoPR3Wr6n/rbiihGYCIzvuY4/U5GigNUGls/QUbCPRyzho30wIDAQAB&quot;</code></pre><p>If no result is returned, verify that you added the TXT record with the correct subdomain. Remember the &quot;Name&quot; field in DNSimple should not include your domain name, otherwise you&#39;d create a record at <code>subdomain.yourdomain.com.yourdomain.com</code>.</p>\n<h2>Verifying your DKIM with an online tool</h2>\n<p>Verify your DKIM with an online tool like <a href=\"https://www.mail-tester.com/spf-dkim-check\">this one</a> from Treehouse. This tool verifies that you have SPF and DKIM records. In the DKIM selector field, just add the first part from the subdomain your DKIM is under. For example, if your DKIM is at <code>google._domainkey.aetrion.com</code>, then the DKIM selector is &quot;google&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Technical details</h2>\n<p>If you want to read more about the technical details of DKIM, head over to <a href=\"http://www.dkim.org/\">DKIM.org</a>.</p>\n","data":{"title":"What's a DKIM Record?","excerpt":"What a DKIM record is, and how DKIM records work.","categories":["DNS","Emails"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/dkim-record"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>Disabling Expiration Notifications</h1>\n<p>If you&#39;ve disabled auto-renewal on the domain you want to let expire, simply toggle the checkbox <label>Email me when this domain is about to expire</label> which appears on the card showing the registration status of your domain management page of non-auto-renewing domains.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/files/disable-expiration-notifications.png\" alt=\"Disable Expiration Notifications Link\"></p>\n<p>Be careful with this feature.

Others are less relevant, deprecated, or replaced.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/supported-dns-records\">DNSimple supports common and traditional record types</a>, along with some newer types introduced to provide innovative services. In this article, we&#39;ll look at the most common record types, and explore the most common DNS records you need for your domains to work.</p>\n<h2>Common record types</h2>\n<p>These are the most common DNS record types:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/a-record\"><code>A</code> record</a></td>\n<td>This is the most popular type. A records create a DNS record that points to an IPv4 address. It allows you to use memonic names, such as <code>www.example.com</code>, in place of IP addresses like <code>127.0.0.1</code>.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/cname-record\"><code>CNAME</code> record</a></td>\n<td>This record works as an alias and maps one name to another. It&#39;s often used to reduce duplication in domain name configurations. It also simplifies the maintenance of multiple records connected to the same IP address. It&#39;s one of the common mechanisms that&#39;s been adopted by cloud services to provision customer-specific services.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/mx-record\"><code>MX</code> record</a></td>\n<td>This record is used to identify the servers mail should be delivered to for a domain. You need to have these records configured to receive emails.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/txt-record\"><code>TXT</code> record</a></td>\n<td>This record is used to associate text with a domain.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ns-record\"><code>NS</code> record</a></td>\n<td>This record is used to delegate a subzone to a set of name servers. These are the types of records you need to modify when you want to delegate a domain to a DNS provider.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/soa-record\"><code>SOA</code> record</a></td>\n<td>This record stores important information about the DNS zone (your domain). Each zone must have an SOA record. However, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll have to create a SOA record directly. DNSimple automatically manages the SOA records for all your domains.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2>Common DNS records</h2>\n<p>Although each domain is unique, and will likely have a special DNS configuration, there&#39;s a basic set of DNS records that&#39;s common among the majority of domains.</p>\n<p>If you just purchased a domain or are reviewing your domain&#39;s DNS configuration, compare the DNS records in your domain with the following to determine whether or not anything&#39;s missing:</p>\n<info>\nThis article assumes `example.com` is your domain name.\n</info>\n\n<h3>1. Root domain (<code>example.com</code>)</h3>\n<p>Each domain needs to have a record for the root domain. Otherwise your domain won&#39;t resolve, and accessing the URL in the browser will return a resolution error.</p>\n<p>In most cases, this configuration is an A record pointing to the IP where your site is hosted. However, it can also be an ALIAS if your site is hosted elsewhere (this is common when you want to point your root domain to a cloud service, such as Heroku, Netlify, GitHub, etc.), or a URL record if the domain needs to redirect elsewhere.</p>\n<div class=\"section-steps\" markdown=\"1\">\n##### To verify\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Use <code>dig example.com</code> to check the presence of a root record.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The answer should return at least one A record as below:</p>\n<pre><code> dig dnsimple.com\n\n ;; ANSWER SECTION:\n dnsimple.com.        59    IN    A    104.245.210.170</code></pre> <info>\n Both ALIAS and URL records are synthetized as A records.\n </info>\n\n <note>\n If you see a CNAME record, your configuration is invalid. The CNAME can't be used for the root domain.\n </note>\n</div>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>2. www subdomain: (<code>www.example.com</code>)</h3>\n<p>It&#39;s common to have the <code>www</code> subdomain configured in addition to the root domain. There are several possibilities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using an A record to point to the same IP of the root domain.</li>\n<li>Using a CNAME record to point to the root domain.</li>\n<li>Using a URL record to redirect to the root domain.</li>\n</ol>\n<tip>\nUsing an ALIAS record for the `www` subdomain is not incorrect, however it's generally unnecessary. In most cases, you can replace the ALIAS with the CNAME.\n</tip>\n\n<div class=\"section-steps\" markdown=\"1\">\n##### To verify\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Use <code>dig www.example.com</code> to check the presence of a www record.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The answer should return at least one A record or exactly one CNAME record as below:</p>\n<pre><code> dig www.dnsimple.com\n\n ;; ANSWER SECTION:\n www.dnsimple.com.    59    IN    A    104.245.210.170</code></pre><pre><code> dig www.dnsimple.com\n\n ;; ANSWER SECTION:\n www.dnsimple.com.    3599    IN    CNAME    dnsimple.com.\n dnsimple.com.        59    IN    A    104.245.210.170</code></pre></div>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>3. MX email records</h3>\n<p>If you want to receive emails for your domain, you need to have at least one MX record pointing to your doamin mail server. For rendudancy, there are generally two or more MX records, each with different content and priority.</p>\n<div class=\"section-steps\" markdown=\"1\">\n##### To verify\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Use <code>dig MX example.com</code> to check the presence of MX records on the root domain.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The answer should return at least one MX record as below:</p>\n<pre><code> dig MX www.dnsimple.com\n\n ;; ANSWER SECTION:\n dnsimple.com.        3599    IN    MX    1 aspmx.l.google.com.\n dnsimple.com.        3599    IN    MX    5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.\n dnsimple.com.        3599    IN    MX    5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.\n dnsimple.com.        3599    IN    MX    10 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.\n dnsimple.com.        3599    IN    MX    10 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.</code></pre></div>\n\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>4.

CNAME stands for Canonical Name. </p>\n<p>A common example is when you have both <code>example.com</code> and <code>www.example.com</code> pointing to the same application and hosted by the same server. In this case, to avoid maintaining two different records, it&#39;s common to create:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <code>A</code> record for <code>example.com</code> pointing to the server IP address</li>\n<li>A <code>CNAME</code> record for <code>www.example.com</code> pointing to <code>example.com</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a result, <code>example.com</code> points to the server IP address, and <code>www.example.com</code> points to the same address via <code>example.com</code>. Should the IP address change, you only need to update it in one place: just edit the A record for <code>example.com</code>, and <code>www.example.com</code> automatically inherits the changes.</p>\n<note>\nA CNAME record must always point to another domain name, never directly to an IP address.\n</note>\n\n<p>The DNS A record is specified by <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035\">RFC 1035</a>.</p>\n<h2>Restrictions</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>A CNAME record must always point to another domain name and never directly to an IP address.</li>\n<li>A CNAME record cannot co-exist with another record for the same name. It&#39;s not possible to have both a CNAME and TXT record for <code>www.example.com</code>.</li>\n<li>A CNAME can point to another CNAME, although this configuration is generally not recommended for performance reasons. When applicable, the CNAME should point as closely as possible to the target name in order to avoid unnecessary performance overheads.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>CNAME record format </h2>\n<p>The structure of an A record follows the standard top-level format definition defined <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.1\">RFC 1035</a>. The RDATA section is composed of one single element:</p>\n<p>|:------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| domain-name | A domain name which specifies the canonical or primary name for the record. |</p>\n<p>The canonical representation is:</p>\n<pre><code>CNAME &lt;domain-name&gt;</code></pre><p>where <code>&lt;domain-name&gt;</code> is a fully-qualified domain name such as <code>example.com</code>.</p>\n<p>In DNSimple, the CNAME record is represented by the following customizable elements:</p>\n<p>|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Name    | The host name for the record, without the domain name. This is generally referred to as &quot;subdomain&quot;. We automatically append the domain name. |\n| TTL     | The time-to-live in seconds. This is the amount of time the record is allowed to be cached by a resolver.                                  |\n| Content | The domain-name the CNAME maps to.                                                                                                         |</p>\n<h2>CNAME and Redirect</h2>\n<p>The CNAME record is sometimes improperly referred to as <em>redirect</em>, generally in the context of web (HTTP) redirects.</p>\n<p>There is no direct correlation between a CNAME and an HTTP redirect, nor does configuring CNAME automatically result in any HTTP redirect.\nIn order to perform an HTTP redirect, the server responding to the HTTP request must be configured to return an appropriate HTTP response. This is not directly achievable using a CNAME.</p>\n<p>You can learn more by reading the <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/differences-between-a-cname-alias-url\">differences between the A, CNAME, ALIAS and URL records</a>. DNSimple provides a special <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/url-record\">URL record</a> that can be used to configure an HTTP redirect.</p>\n<h2>Querying CNAME records</h2>\n<p>You can use <code>dig</code> to determine the CNAME record associated to a domain name. The result is contained in the <code>ANSWER</code> section. It contains the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), the remaining time-to-live (TTL), and the domain-name.</p>\n<pre><code>$ dig CNAME www.dnsimple.com\n\n; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.6 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; CNAME www.dnsimple.com\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 5274\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n\n;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\n; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;www.dnsimple.com.

This method is available if you create an account via their website. To use this method first configure your DNS at CloudFlare. Next, &quot;Manage&quot; your domain at DNSimple, follow &quot;Change Name Servers&quot;, and enter CloudFlare supplied name servers.</li>\n<li>Through third-party &quot;Certified Hosting Provider Partners&quot;. In this case DNSimple manages automatic provisioning and configuration of your CloudFlare account and DNS template. This greatly simplifies CloudFlare integration for your domain and allows you to continue using DNSimple as your <a href=\"https://dnsimple.com/about\">DNS service provider</a>. &quot;Manage&quot; your domain, press the &quot;One-Click Services&quot; button near the top of the page, and &quot;Add&quot; CloudFlare.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Direct Integration</h3>\n<p>Direct integration requires to change the name servers for your domain to point to CloudFlare name servers.</p>\n<p>If your domain is registered with DNSimple, follow these instructions to <a href=\"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/setting-name-servers\">configure the name servers for a domain</a>. If the domain is registered elsewhere, you will need to follow the instructions of your existing domain registrar to point the domain to CloudFlare. In both cases, once the domain is pointing to CloudFlare, you will need to manage the DNS records in CloudFlare. Any DNS change in your DNSimple account for that domain will no longer have any effect, including changing DNS records, enabling/disabling one-click services and enabling/disabling email forwards.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the direct integration doesn&#39;t allow selectively delegating only certain DNS records to CloudFlare. If you want to use CloudFlare only for a specific DNS record (e.g. for the main website) and use DNSimple for all the other records (e.g. MX email configurations), then use the one-click DNSimple integration.</p>\n<h3>DNSimple one-click integration</h3>\n<p>DNSimple one-click integration allows you to use CloudFlare to proxy only a specific DNS record of a domain. This is the preferred option, for example, if you want to take advantage of CloudFlare&#39;s CDN and protection for the main website, maintaining the other DNS records in DNSimple.</p>\n<p>However, this approach has some limitations. For instance, CloudFlare doesn&#39;t allow to use the Universal SSL feature for domains or subdomains managed from a third-party provider. More information below.</p>\n<h2>DNS limitations</h2>\n<p>CloudFlare caches your site content at locations across the globe. It uses DNS to route your requests to one of these locations depending on various factors. To support this technology within DNS limitations it is best to use a host name (i.e. <a href=\"http://www.example.com\">www.example.com</a>) rather than your domain apex (i.e. example.com). CNAME records at a domain apex are disallowed or will cause your DNS respond incorrectly. You may wish to use DNSimple&#39;s URL redirection record to forward requests from your domain apex to &quot;www&quot; for instance.</p>\n<h2>ALIAS record limitations</h2>\n<p>DNSimple offers a virtual record type called an ALIAS record. This allows sites to work around a limitation of CNAME records at the domain apex by resolving to an A record at the name server. Our ALIAS record cannot be used with the CloudFlare service at this time. If you need this functionality then you may either use another CDN provider, or you may use CloudFlare directly by creating an account with them and delegating your registered domain to their name servers.</p>\n<h2>Universal SSL limitations</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl\">CloudFlare Universal SSL</a> is currently available only if you use Cloudflare directly (first integration method). It&#39;s not possible to use CloudFlare Universal SSL if you enable Cloudflare using DNSimple one-click service.</p>\n<h2>Enabling CloudFlare service </h2>\n<p>From the domain page, switch to the <label>Services</label> tab and click to <label>Add or edit service</label>.

They also provide a means of indicating notification rules in case someone requests a certificate from an unauthorized certificate authority. If no CAA record is present, any CA is allowed to issue a certificate for the domain. If a CAA record is present, only the CAs listed in the record(s) are allowed to issue certificates for that hostname.</p>\n<p>CAA records can set policy for the entire domain, or for specific hostnames. CAA records are also inherited by subdomains. Therefore, a CAA record set on <code>example.com</code> also applies to any subdomain, such as <code>subdomain.example.com</code> (unless overridden). CAA records can control the issuance single-name certificates, wildcard certificates, or both.</p>\n<p>The DNS CAA record is specified by <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844\">RFC 6844</a>.</p>\n<h2>CAA record format </h2>\n<p>The structure of a CAA record follows the standard top-level format definition defined <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-3.2.1\">RFC 1035</a>. The RDATA section is composed of the following elements:</p>\n<p>|:------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| flag  | An unsigned integer between 0-255.                                                                                                           |\n|       | It is currently used to represent the <em>critical</em> flag, that has a specific meaning per <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844#section-3\">RFC</a>. |\n| tag   | An ASCII string that represents the identifier of the property represented by the record.                                                    |\n| value | The value associated with the tag.                                                                                                           |</p>\n<p>The CAA record consists of a flags byte and a tag-value pair referred to as a &#39;property&#39;. Multiple properties may be associated with the same domain name by publishing multiple CAA RRs at that domain name.</p>\n<p>The canonical representation is:</p>\n<pre><code>CAA &lt;flags&gt; &lt;tag&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></pre><p>The RFC currently defines 3 available tags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>issue</code>: explicity authorizes a single certificate authority to issue a certificate (any type) for the hostname.</li>\n<li><code>issuewild</code>: explicity authorizes a single certificate authority to issue a wildcard certificate (and only wildcard) for the hostname.</li>\n<li><code>iodef</code>: specifies a URL to which a certificate authority may report policy violations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In DNSimple, the CAA record is represented by the following customizable elements:</p>\n<p>|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Name  | The host name for the record, without the domain name. This is generally referred to as &quot;subdomain&quot;. We automatically append the domain name. |\n| TTL   | The time-to-live in seconds. This is the amount of time the record is allowed to be cached by a resolver.                                  |\n| Tag   | An ASCII string that represents the identifier of the property represented by the record.                                                  |\n| Value | The value associated with the tag.                                                                                                         |</p>\n<info>\nWe don't allow configuration of the bit flag.\n</info>\n\n\n<h2>CAA record usage</h2>\n<p>As explained in the format section, each CAA record contains only one tag-value pair. The tag must be one of the available tags. For example, if we want to limit the issuance of SSL certificates for <code>example.com</code> to the Let&#39;s Encrypt certificate authority, we should add the following CAA record:</p>\n<pre><code>example.com.  CAA 0 issue &quot;letsencrypt.org&quot;</code></pre><p>If we want to allow both Let&#39;s Encrypt and Comodo, we should add 2 CAA records, one for each CA:</p>\n<pre><code>example.com.  CAA 0 issue &quot;comodoca.com&quot;\nexample.com.  CAA 0 issue &quot;letsencrypt.org&quot;</code></pre><p>If we want to allow Let&#39;s Encrypt and Comodo only for wildcard, then we can use <code>issuewild</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>example.com.  CAA 0 issue &quot;letsencrypt.org&quot;\nexample.com.  CAA 0 issuewild &quot;comodoca.com&quot;</code></pre><p>Note that the presence of issuewild overrides the <code>issue</code>. Therefore, Let&#39;s Encrypt <em>is not allowed</em> to issue wildcard certificates.</p>\n<p>Finally, to be notified of policy violations, you can add a record with the <code>iodef</code> tag that contains the email address to notify:</p>\n<pre><code>example.com.  CAA 0 iodef &quot;mailto:example@example.com&quot;</code></pre><p>As mentioned before, the records are inherited by child hostnames. Let&#39;s look at an example of subdomain configuration:</p>\n<pre><code>example.com.        CAA 0 issue &quot;letsencrypt.org&quot;\nalpha.example.com.  CAA 0 issue &quot;comodoca.com&quot;\nbeta.example.com.   CAA 0 issue &quot;letsencrypt.org&quot;\nbeta.example.com.   CAA 0 issue &quot;comodoca.com&quot;</code></pre><p>In the example above, Let&#39;s Encrypt is the default CA for the example.com domain. However, only Comodo can issue a certificate for <code>alpha.example.com</code>. Both Comodo and Let&#39;s Encrypt can issue certificates for <code>beta.example.com</code>. And what about <code>foo.example.com</code>? Because no record exists for <code>foo.example.com</code>, but there is a record for <code>example.com</code>, in this case only Let&#39;s Encrypt is allowed to issue for <code>foo.example.com</code>.</p>\n<note>\n#### Comodo Wildcard Certificates\n\n<p>Customers who purchase a Comodo wildcard certificate from us need to make sure they have an <code>issue</code> and <code>issuewild</code> CAA record, because they add an additional single-name to the certificate to cover the non-wildcard name. For example, buying a certificate for <code>*.example.com</code> issues a certificate with both <code>example.com</code> and <code>*.example.com</code> in the certificate names. This means you need to configure your CAA records like so:</p>\n<pre><code>example.com.  CAA 0 issue &quot;comodoca.com&quot;\nexample.com.  CAA 0 issuewild &quot;comodoca.com&quot;</code></pre><p>The above rules apply to subdomain wildcard certificates as well.\n</note></p>\n<h2>Querying CAA records</h2>\n<p>The CAA record is a relatively new resource record (RR), and not all tools support it. A notable example is <code>dig</code>; it doesn&#39;t support the standard syntax for querying CAA records. In order to query the CAA record for a domain with <code>dig</code> you must specify the RR type (257) directly.</p>\n<pre><code>$ dig google.com type257\n\n; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; google.com type257\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 64266\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0\n\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;google.com.

The ALIAS record will automatically resolve your domain to one or more A records at resolution time, and resolvers see your domain simply as if it had A records.</p>\n<h2>How ALIAS record works</h2>\n<p>The DNSimple name servers are based on an open source Erlang DNS server we developed with the help of others in the DNS community. The erl-DNS server provides a mechanism for plugging in custom handlers, and we use that extension mechanism for providing an ALIAS handler. Each time a request hits the DNSimple name servers for either an A or AAAA record type, the custom handler is invoked and attempts to resolve the ALIAS into its appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 address. It does this by asking a resolver to resolve the domain. We are running PowerDNS&#39;s resolver locally on each system for this purpose.</p>\n<p>If the resolution succeeds, the handler extracts the A and AAAA records and returns them to the erl-dns server process, which then goes on its way. It also sticks the result in an in-memory cache.\nIf the resolution fails, for example due to a timeout, then the cached response is returned, if one exists. We have the request timeout set quite low (500 milliseconds), and we may move it lower in the future. If there&#39;s no response in the cache, the request is retried again, up to the maximum number of retries. If the request ultimately fails, we return an empty result set.</p>\n<p>To support secondary DNS servers, especially ones that connect to us and pull zones using AXFR, we must resolve the ALIAS differently. Currently we resolve it as part of the secondary DNS setup process, then run a scheduled job to update the ALIAS record at secondary name servers by resolving them again, removing the old records, and writing the new records to our zone transfer database. We then send a NOTIFY message to the appropriate secondary name servers.</p>\n<p>The actual implementation is handled by a small Go application which our Rails application calls, either from within Rails execution or in an asynchronous job, to handle the resolution. The Go application calls Google&#39;s public resolvers to resolve the ALIAS record.</p>\n<p>When creating an ALIAS record you&#39;ll notice an additional TXT field is created. This field is optional and can be used for debugging.</p>\n","data":{"title":"What's an ALIAS record?","excerpt":"What an ALIAS record is, and how to add an ALIAS record in DNSimple.","categories":["DNS"],"url":"http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/alias-record"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"<h1>Adding a Subdomain</h1>\n<p>A subdomain is a DNS record for a hostname that belongs to your domain.
