# DNSimple Help Site

This is the [DNSimple Help site](http://support.dnsimple.com) built with [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/).

## Setup

Ruby 1.9, or higher, is required to build the site. Dependencies are managed using Bundler.

    $ git clone https://github.com/aetrion/dnsimple-support.git
    $ cd dnsimple-support
    $ bundle

For a list of `nanoc` commands type

    $ nanoc --help

## Development

`nanoc` ships with an autocompiler that automatically compiles changed files on every HTTP request.

    $ nanoc aco

## Deployment

To publish the site to S3, thus allowing HTTPS:

First, install Java (note on OS X I had to install the full JDK to get the command line `java`). Next, add a .env file with following:

    S3_ID=ACCESS_ID
    S3_SECRET=ACCESS_KEY

Finally, run:

    $ rake publish
