    $ cd dnsimple-support
    $ bundle

## Deployment

Each commit to master is [deployed automatically via Travis](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2016/04/publish-static-via-travis-to-cloudfront/).

### Manual deployment

To publish the site manually you will need Java (as the static deployer is written in Scala).

Add a `.env` file with following variables, replacing `ACCESS_ID` and `ACCESS_KEY` with the real values.

    S3_ID=ACCESS_ID
    S3_SECRET=ACCESS_KEY

Finally, run:

    $ rake publish
