**Support Writing Guidelines** 

**Tone**

* Straightforward and friendly. 
* We want to be professional, and convey knowledge, but without alienating new users or those who aren't 100% familiar with the terms.

**Use gender-neutral language**

* Always opt for they/them/you language over she/him.
* They and their can be used as singular pronouns.  
* Don't default to masculine pronouns. 

**Tense**

* Always use present tense when applicable. It’s stronger.
* Every sub-header (when possible) should use the present continuous form. 
   * Examples: 
      * Using 2FA 
      * Verifying NS Records 
* Using “will” makes it sound like it'll happen in the future. If you're doing things now, say it.
* Don’t use time-sensitive language.
    * Examples: 'for now', 'currently', or 'for the time being'. 
    * The site is written in present tense and reflects what you're doing now, so this language is redundant and unnecessary. 

**Standardize capitalization**

* Main titles should have all words capitalized. Descriptions should not. 
* Headers (H2, H3) should have the first word capitalized. 

**Punctuation**

* There should be a period at the end of every sentence line in a bulleted list. You don't need periods with lists made of  one/two-word items. 
   * Example 1 (period needed): 
       * 1. Log in to DNSimple. 
       * 2. Go to the Domain page. 
   * Example 2 (no punctuation required): 
       * 1. DNS hosting
       * 2. DDoS Defense 
       * 3. One-click services
* Use Oxford commas. 
* If you're not sure about that semi-colon, avoid it. It's just as easy to write two separate sentences, so semi-colons are often unnecessary. 
* Exclamation points are super fun... sparingly. Use them with discretion, and if you're not sure, don't use them at all. Support docs won't have much call for exclamation points. 

**Adverbs**

* Adverbs add length without contributing depth. 
* 99% of the time you won’t need that adverb. “Interestingly”, “usually”, “generally”, “typically” are used often, and most of the time they don’t need to be there. 
* Very, really, a lot - these are unnecessary filler words. Try to avoid them in support writing. We want to keep things as clean and concise as possible. 

**Avoid negative language**

* Avoid words like “pain points” and “hassle”.
    * These words create visceral reactions in readers, and we don't want anyone associating DNSimple with pain or hassle, even if that's not what you're trying to say. 
* Avoid saying things like 'We do all this for you'. This places a burden of gratitude on the client. They absolutely should appreciate the service, but you should never point that out. Just keep making it great, and you don't have to remind them how good you are.
