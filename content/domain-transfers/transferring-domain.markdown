# Transferring a Domain to DNSimple

If you simply want to use DNSimple to host your DNS for a domain, then follow our instructions for switching to our name servers.

If you want DNSimple to act as your domain registrar then the basic process is as follows:

- First make sure that you unlock your domain at its current registrar and get your domain authorization code. This code is often sent by your current registrar via email.
- Log into DNSimple and click on "Add a Domain"
- Check the box that says "Register or transfer this domain"
- You may also enable "Whois Privacy Protection" so that it is enabled immediately upon completion of the transfer by checking the "Enable WHOIS Privacy Protection" check box.
- Press "Add Domain"
- Select a registrant and fill in any extended attributes that are required.
- Press "Transfer Domain"

Your domain transfer request will now be issued if there are no missing fields. You will receive an email requesting approval of the transfer. Follow the instructions in the email. Within 7 days your domain transfer request should complete.

The authorization email comes from info@transfer-approval.com and will be sent to the administrative contact in your current public whois details. In order to receive the email you may have to turn off whois privacy at your current registrar. Many registrars will not properly deliver transfer authorization emails when whois privacy is enabled. 

We will only charge your credit card for the transfer once it has completed.

You can go to your domain list at any time to check on the status of pending transfers. Click on "transfer in process" to view detailed information about the transfer requests.
