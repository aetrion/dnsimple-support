# What is Whois Privacy Protection?

Most domain names registered through DNSimple, or any other domain registrar for that matter, require the collection of essential contact information, such as the registrant's name, email address, mailing address, phone number, etc. This information is used in case a dispute arises about the domain name.

This information is often displayed in the global Whois system (also known as WHOIS). Information displayed in the global Whois system is public and can be viewed by anyone.

If you would like to keep your contact information private for a domain then you may sign up for the DNSimple Whois Privacy Protection service (WPPS). This service will replace the public information that you provide with an anonymous proxy identity in the public Whois database. This includes replacing your email address with a proxy email address and replacing your address and contact information with the information from an entity called "Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc.".

The cost for this service is $8 per year, per domain.

You can choose to purchase Whois Privacy Protection for any of your domains in TLDs that support WPPS at any time.

Here is an example of the the Whois data for a domain that has Whois Privacy Protection enabled:
