Welcome to [DNSimple](/articles/dnsimple-services/)! We're here to make your transition from ClickFunnels as easy as possible – after all, [Simple](/articles/how-is-dnsimple-pronounced/) is in our name.

## Step 1: Setting up a DNSimple account and trial

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Go to [DNSimple.com](https://dnsimple.com). In the upper-right corner of the screen, click the <label>Get Started</label> button.
1. Complete the form using the **same email address associated with your ClickFunnels account**. Enter a password and confirm it. Click <label>Join DNSimple</label>.
1. Now choose a plan. Select <label>Continue</label> under <label>Individual</label>, then choose <label>Get Started</label> under <label>Personal</label> or <label>Professional</label>, depending on your needs.

    <tip>

1. Add your credit card details, then click <label>Start my free trial</label>.

    <info>
    You can cancel at any time during your 30-day trial without being charged for your [DNSimple subscription](/articles/dnsimple-services/). We ask for a credit card in case you want to purchase products, like [registering](/articles/registering-domain/) or [transferring](/articles/transferring-domain/) a domain, or [getting an SSL certificate](/articles/ordering-standard-certificate/) to secure your site. Your [account will not be activated](/articles/account-activation/) until you add a credit card.
    </info>
</div>


## Step 2: Asking ClickFunnels to move the domain to your DNSimple account

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Send an email to [billing@clickfunnels.com](mailto:billing@clickfunnels.com) using the email address associated with your ClickFunnels account. You can use this template, replacing the placeholders with your information:

    > Hi there,

    > I would like to move my domain(s) from ClickFunnels to my DNSimple account.

    > i. Confirm that you created a paid DNSimple account.

    > YES

    > ii. Provide the email address associated with your ClickFunnels and DNSimple accounts.

    > `your email address`

    > iii. Name of domain(s) you want to transfer.

    > `your domain(s)`

    > iv. Verify the last 4 digits of the card we have on file for your ClickFunnels account.

    > `last 4 digits of your credit card`

    > Thanks!

1. ClickFunnels will reply to your email once they have moved the domain into your account. You will also receive an email from DNSimple letting you know the domain is waiting for you.

  ![Email alerting you that a domain push is pending](/files/domain-push-email.png)
</div>


## Step 3: Accepting the domain and getting it set up in DNSimple

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. [Log into DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/login) where you'll see a <label>Get Started</label> screen. None of these options apply to what you're looking to do. Select <label>Skip this and go to the dashboard</label> found under the three boxes of options. Explore these other options in the [section below](#other-options-when-getting-started-with-a-new-account).
1. Welcome to the [Dashboard](https://dnsimple.com/dashboard)! This is the homepage of your DNSimple account. You'll see a box to the right that says <label>Alerts</label>. Click <label>View</label> to see your pending domain push and accept it.
1. You will see <label>Push Requests</label> and your domain listed below. Click <label>Accept</label> to the right of the domain.
1. Now that you have accepted the push of the domain, you need to change the Registrant information. This information states that you are the owner of the domain. When the domain was with ClickFunnels, they were listed as the owner, which is why we need to update this. See [Updating the registrant information](#updating-the-registrant-information) for a description of each field.

    <note>
    After the domain is pushed into your DNSimple account, you must also change the ownership of the domain from ClickFunnels to yourself. This [locks the domain for further transfers](/articles/icann-60-day-lock-registrant-change/) for 60 days in accordance with ICANN's rules, meaning that you have to keep your domain here at DNSimple for 60 days before you can transfer the domain elsewhere. Hopefully, you aren't looking to move it but if you are, we will discuss some options later in the article.
    </note>

    <warning>
    You will receive a verification email to the email address you used for the domain contact requesting you verify you made a change to the contact information. If you are moving your domain from ClickFunnels, you did make this change and you will want to verify it as soon as you receive the email. Sometimes it lands in spam, so be on the lookout for it.

    Ignoring this message will lead to a suspended website, meaning it won't work. If this does happen, as soon as you verify it the suspension will be lifted.

    You will receive a confirmation email after you have verified letting you know the verification was successful. There is nothing you need to do with this email.
    </warning>

1. Click <label>Accept Push</label>. You will then be brought to the domain's page and you'll see a banner stating the domain has been successfully pushed to your account.
</div>

Congratulations! You're now the owner of the domain and are managing the DNS.

### Updating the registrant information

Let's breakdown what information we're asking for:

| Name                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Label                  | You can give contacts a unique label, which is helpful when managing multiple contacts. No need to worry about this now—let's leave this field blank.                                                                                                                       |
| First Name / Last Name | Enter the first and last name of the person you want listed as the owner of the domain. In most cases, this person will be you.                                                                                                                                              |
| Email                  | Make sure this is accurate. You're going to be sent emails verifying your information that you will be required to approve. If you enter your email address incorrectly, this email will not be delivered and you could face a suspension of your domain until it is fixed. |
| Organization Name      | If the domain is to be registered for a company, you'll enter that here. For now, let's leave this blank.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Job Title              | As above, if the domain were being registered for a company, you'll enter your job title. Let's leave this blank too.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Phone                  | Enter your complete phone number starting with the country code.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Fax                    | This is usually relevant for company registrations—we'll leave this blank as well.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Address                | Enter your complete physical or postal address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Other options when getting started with a new account

#### Add a domain

If you were purchasing a new domain or transferring a domain in from another provider, like GoDaddy, you would choose this. You are not transferring a domain in from ClickFunnels because they use DNSimple as their registrar already. You are moving your domain from ClickFunnels' DNSimple account into your DNSimple account.

#### Request an SSL certificate

If you need to purchase a certificate right away, you can choose this option. ClickFunnels includes a certificate to make your site secure with their services. We will go over Certificates shortly, this option isn't necessary right now.

#### Explore the API

The API is a great resource for those with a technical background to take advantage of automation. It may be something that you want to look into and explore. I will provide links to helpful articles explaining the API at the end of this document, you don't need to dive in just yet.


## Step 4: Understanding the domain homepage

Let's go through what you're seeing on the home page for the domain to make it a little less daunting.

### Domain Delegation

What you see in this card are the name servers. Name servers work as a directory that translate domain names into IP addresses and are important because they make things easy to find across the Internet.

<div class="mb4 aspect-ratio aspect-ratio--16x9 z-0">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2WdF1zT01HY" class="aspect-ratio--object" frameborder="0" allow="accelero    meter; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

You don't need to change the name servers when you move your domain from ClickFunnels.

The only reason you would need to change the name servers is if you are looking to [manage your DNS with another provider](/articles/setting-name-servers/#pointing-the-name-servers-to-another-provider), like GoDaddy or CloudFlare, and keep your registration with us.

<info>
Any changes made to DNS or certificates will only work if the name servers are pointing to that provider. If you make changes to your certificates here in DNSimple, but you moved your delegation to CloudFlare, those changes will not be reflected on your site.
</info>

<warning>
You must have an active subscription with the provider you're pointing the name servers to in order for your DNS to resolve. Read [what happens if you stop paying for your DNSimple subscription](/articles/what-happens-if-i-stop-paying/).
</warning>

### Registered

#### Renew by date

This is the date a year after you purchased your domain. You will own the domain until this date, even if you're not using it.

To prevent the domain from going into the expiration process we recommend [turning on Auto Renewal](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/). This prevents the stress of forgetting to renew your domain. We will begin the renewal process a month before the domain expires ensuring everything is set and ready to go before your renewal date.

If you forgot to turn on the Auto Renewal and you want to keep the domain, that's okay. There is a [lengthy expiration process](/articles/what-happens-when-domain-expires/) and time to get it back. If you wait too long and it's in the Redemption Period, there will be a penalty fee, typically $100, you'll be required to pay in addition to the standard renewal costs.

Below the Renew by date you will see the option to turn on Auto Renew with what the standard registration costs.

#### Transfer this domain to another provider:

If you are looking to move the domain to another provider, you will need to unlock the domain and request an authorization code. This is done with one click following these steps [here](/articles/transferring-domain-away/).

<note>
You will not be able to transfer your domain for 60 days after accepting the push from ClickFunnels. This is due to the 60 day ICANN [lock after a change of registrant](/articles/icann-60-day-lock-registrant-change/).
</note>

### Contact

This is the information you provided when you moved the domain over. This is the ownership contact information for Whois. You should not need to make any changes to this, unless you spot an error or your information changes.

Under this, you'll see the option to [enable Whois Privacy](/articles/whois-privacy/). This is at to your discretion, but know that per GDPR common TLDs like `.COM` automatically redact the information in the Whois information. You can learn more about this [here](/articles/domain-privacy-after-gdpr/).

### Activity

Any [changes you make](/articles/activity-tracking/#activity-tracking-at-the-domain-level) to your DNS will show here for reference. If you make a lot of changes, or want to look back on a change you made a while ago, you can select View to look it over.

### DNS

The DNS section of your domain will go through the records and other technical options you need to have your domain function properly. We will break down each section below.

#### Secondary DNS

This is a feature you can take advantage of and have the DNS with another provider should we face any downtime. It is not necessary to set up, but if you want to learn more about it, you can do so [here](/articles/secondary-dnsimple/).

#### One Click Services

This makes connecting your site to other popular services painless. It takes just [one click](/articles/services/) to connect them and we handle the record set up. I wouldn't worry about this feature yet, but feel free to take a look at the options here and see if anything makes sense for you to connect to. Your site will function properly without using these features.

#### DNS records

This information transferred over from ClickFunnels. If you go to your site and all is functioning as it should you will not need to change anything. Leave everything as is.

Reasons why you would update the DNS is if you have unsubscribed from ClickFunnels and are using another service to host the content of your site. The content and DNS management are two different things. The content is what your site looks like when you visit it, it's the design and layout you created with services like ClickFunnels. The content is not managed with DNSimple, we just tell your site where to find it.

Click **Manage** to look at the records and edit them.

When you open up the DNS Record Management page you'll probably see the following records:

- `ALIAS` - your domain name will be listed under **Name** and the **Content** is `target.clickfunnels.com`.
- There will be 4 `NS` records. These are the name server records.
- `SOA` - Also related to name servers and nothing you need to edit.
- `TXT` - again you'll see your domain name and `ALIAS` for `target.clickfunnels.com`.
- `URL` - Here you'll see your domain name with the `www` and `https://`.

<warning>
If you remove your `ALIAS` record, your site will stop resolving. If you remove the `TXT` record your site will still work, though there is no reason to remove this record.
</warning>

If you go to your website and you are just seeing the ClickFunnels home page and not your site, you will need to reach out to ClickFunnels. More than likely, you did not change the primary landing page within your account when they were still managing the DNS. They should be able to tell you what you need to input to get it pointing to the right place.

##### Understanding the Record Editor

If you no longer are using ClickFunnels, and have created a website with a service like Wix, you will need to point your site to them. This can be done one of two ways. You will either need to change the name servers to them, which is done to allow them to manage the DNS of your domain, similar to how it was set up with ClickFunnels, or they will share the DNS records you need to add to DNSimple.

We will not know what records are needed from the content host. You will need to contact them and ask them the following:

I am using DNSimple to manage the DNS of my domain. I have recently created a site using your company. Please share with me the DNS records I need to add to DNSimple to have what I created shown on my website.

They will then share with you the documentation that includes the records, name servers you need to change it to, or respond directly with the records needed.

We have something called the [Record Editor](/articles/record-editor/) to make adding records very easy. You will click on **Manage** to open up the editor.


## Step 5: Understanding certificates

### What are certificates?

Certificates provide a level of security for your site. If you look in the browser bar, in Chrome for example, there is a locked lock to the left of the URL showing that this is a secure website. If it isn't secured by a certificate it will either say Not Secure with an unlocked lock icon to the left of the URL and/or it could block the page and force the visitor to accept the risk in visiting the site. Needless to say, certificates are important.

When you purchased your domain with ClickFunnels, they secured it automatically with a certificate. Typically, the certificate transfers with your domain to continue the protection, but certificates have a short life span and will expire. The certificate they use is only available on higher tiered plans, meaning, if you are on the Personal Plan, you won't be able to renew the same certificate. That's okay. There are many certificates available to you that will provide you with the security you need.

This certificate may be set to [automatically renew](/articles/letsencrypt/#auto-renewal), I'd recommend disabling this if it is to prevent it from trying to renew and sending you failed renewal emails.

Before we dive into the certificate options, I do want to walk you through what you're going to run into when your certificate is about to expire. You'll be notified by us with an email that has the subject line "Expiration Notification". Don't be startled by this, even if the certificate expires, your site will still function and you will still own it. As we went over in the previous paragraph, some certificates may be set to automatically renew. If your certificate is set to auto renew and you haven't disabled it before the renewal, you will receive emails that the renewal failed because you don't have access to the SAN feature. This is the piece that is available on the higher tiered plans. You can ignore these messages, and again these notifications are only concerning your certificate and have no connection to your domain ownership, renewal or overall functionality.

### Now, what certificates are you supposed to use?

Let's Encrypt has a standard certificate that will give your site the security it needs. They will need to be renewed every 90 days. When you renew a certificate, you purchase a new one and install it as you did the previous certificate. Let's Encrypt certificates cover your sites when they are the standard format, like `www.dnsimple.com` or `dnsimple.com`.

Here is a step by step walkthrough of [ordering the Let's Encrypt certificate](/articles/ordering-lets-encrypt-certificate/).

If you are looking for a certificate that will cover subdomains, for example, `blog.dnsimple.com`, `store.dnsimple.com`, `order.dnsimple.com`, then you're going to need something called a [Wildcard Certificate](/articles/ordering-wildcard-certificate/). This is a certificate that covers all of those additional domains. More than likely, you're not going to need this, but if you do, you'll need to upgrade to our Professional Plan (link to how to upgrade account) to access this feature.

Sometimes, ClickFunnels will use a certificate outside of DNSimple. If you gain access to your domain and you don't see a certificate transfer over, but your site is showing as secure, that is probably what happened. We won't be able to offer support to renew this certificate, or make any configuration changes, but we can help you discover when it will expire and answer any questions you may have.
