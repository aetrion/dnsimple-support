# Securing your DNSimple Account

Some simple ways to further secure your DNSimple account:

- Use a password for your account that includes letters, numbers and punctuation. You can even use multiple words or made up phrases.
- Use a long password (16 characters or more).
- Never give your password to someone you don't know. This includes DNSimple support - we'll never ask for your password to help troubleshoot issues.
- Use a unique password for your DNSimple account. Don't reuse a password from another account.
- Don't share your account with others. You can [share the domain](/articles/sharing-domain) or [use the multi-user account feature](/articles/account-users) to allow other users to access your domains.
- For an extra level of security, [enable two-factor authentication](/articles/two-factor-authentication).
