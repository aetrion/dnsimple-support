# Securing your DNSimple Account

Here are some simple rules to follow to help make your DNSimple account more secure:

- Use a password for your account that includes letters, numbers and punctuation characters. You can even use multiple words and made up phrases.
- Use a long password (16 characters or more).
- Never provide your password to someone you do not know. This includes DNSimple support - we do not need your password to help you troubleshoot issues with DNSimple.
- Use a unique password for your DNSimple account. Do not reuse a password from another account.
- Do not share your account with others. You can [share the domain](/articles/sharing-domain/) or set up a team to grant access to your domains.

For an extra level of security [go to your Account page](https://dnsimple.com/account) and enable two-factor auth using Authy. Once you enable two-factor auth you will need log in first with your email and password and then use a generated token obtained either via the Authy application on your phone or via SMS.
