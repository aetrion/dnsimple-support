# Why we don't offer web hosting services

DNS registrars generally offer domains bundled with a hosting solution as part of a basic package. This translates into giving users a few MegaBytes of disk space exposed by an HTTP server and accessible with an FTP client. The intention was that the user could have their personal HTML static site bundled in with the registrarâ€™s offerings. This causes confusion for people who don't deeply understand these technologies.

The web is a diverse and complex place. There are myriad technologies available for creating websites. These technologies require several pieces of software to function: database servers, web servers, caching services, load balancers, etc. Websites need more than just a few MegaBytes of hard disk. Using a website builder is far more effective for most people; average users can build personal sites, without in-depth knowledge. A hosting service can only cater to the tiny fraction of users who still make HTML static websites. 

We don't believe in confusing our customers with complicated options. We prefer to focus on offering an excellent domain management platform. We enable customers to set up and connect their domains to popular services that already exist, rather than trying to create our own top-to-bottom solution. It's a win-win for everyone, and allows us to continue offering effortless, automated DNS registration and management.
