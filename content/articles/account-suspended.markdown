# Suspended Account

There are a variety of reasons your account may be suspended. These reasons include:

- Non-payment of your monthly or yearly subscription fee.
- Chargebacks issued against your account.
- Fraudulent activity.
- Repeated failure to pay outstanding invoices.
- Your account is identified as a root account causing service disruption for other customers.
