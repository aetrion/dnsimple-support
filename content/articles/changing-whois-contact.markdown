To update the WHOIS contact associated with a domain name in DNSimple, simply follow the procedure to [update an existing contact information](/articles/changing-domain-contact/#changing-an-existing-contact-information), or [replace the contact](/articles/changing-domain-contact/#replacing-a-domain-contact) if you want to completely replace the contact details.

Upon the successful update of the domain contact, we will automatically update the registry data and the WHOIS record with the new contact information.

<warning>
#### Special WHOIS policies

Some registries adopt specific contact update policies that may cause the WHOIS update task to fail. The following is a list of the most common registrar-specific policies.
</warning>


## .CH TLD

To change the WHOIS information on a .CH domain, we will need to submit a TRADE request to the registry. The fee for the TRADE is $13.50.

If you want to update the WHOIS information for a .CH domain, please make the aforementioned changes to the contact in DNSimple, and contact us with the name of the domain you want to update.

The TRADE fee will be charged to the card associated to the domain account in DNSimple.


## .IO TLD

The WHOIS changes for a .IO domain requires a manual push to the WHOIS registry.

If you want to update the WHOIS information for a .IO domain, please make the aforementioned changes to the contact in DNSimple, and contact us with the name of the domain you want to update.
