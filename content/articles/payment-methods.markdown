# Payment Methods

DNSimple only supports two payment methods:

## Credit card

<note>
DNSimple doesn't store credit card information. We use a PCI-compliant billing provider to process and store all payment data.
</note>

When you subscribe to DNSimple you will be required to provide a credit card. This card will be used to collect the payment for the subscription fees and all the purchases that you make in DNSimple. These purchases include:
- Domain registrations
- Domain renewals
- Domain transfers
- Comodo single-name SSL certificates
- Comodo wildcard certificates


## Wire transfer

<warning>
This payment method is only available under the Business and Master Reseller subscription plans.
</warning>

Our [Business plan](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) and [Master Reseller plan](https://dnsimple.com/reseller) customers can issue a wire transfer to charge their DNSimple balance. Once DNSimple receives the money, the account credit will be adjusted, and all charges will be deducted from it.

When the credit runs out, the credit card on file will be charged.
