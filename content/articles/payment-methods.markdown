# Payment Methods

DNSimple supports two payment methods:

## Credit or debit card

<note>
DNSimple doesn't store card information. We use a PCI-compliant billing provider to process and store all payment data.
</note>

When you subscribe to DNSimple you will be required to provide a credit or debit card. This card will be used to collect the payment for the subscription fees and all the purchases that you make. These purchases may include:

- Domain registrations
- Domain renewals
- Domain transfers
- Whois privacy
- Comodo single-name SSL certificates
- Comodo wildcard certificates


## ACH or Wire transfer

<warning>
This payment method is only available under the Business and Master Reseller subscription plans.
</warning>

Our [Business plan](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) and [Master Reseller plan](https://dnsimple.com/reseller) customers can issue an ACH payment (for US domestic customers) or a wire transfer (for non-US customers) to charge their DNSimple balance. Once DNSimple receives the money, the account credit will be adjusted, and all charges will be deducted from it.

When the credit runs out, the card on file will be charged.
