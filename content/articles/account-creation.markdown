## New user account

To sign up for an account go to the [DNSimple website](https://dnsimple.com) and click on *Get Started Now*. Fill out the details and press *Sign up*.

You now have a DNSimple account and can begin adding domain names and records.

You will not be able to register a new domain, nor will your domains resolve, until you activate your account by providing your payment details. You may, however, try out the site and see how to manage domains without activating your account.

## Adding additional account

DNSimple allows a user to manage multiple accounts. If you have already signed up for DNSimple, but would like to add another account to your user profile, [follow these steps](/articles/account-multi/#creating).
