<note>
In order to have multiple members on a single account, you must first [be subscribed to an eligible plan](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) for that account.
</note>

Creating a separate account is a flexible and secure way for agencies and freelancers to share domain management with their clients.

Keep in mind that when you add your client as a user to an account, the new member will have full access rights on every resource attached to the account, including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

The member will also have full-admin access to the account, including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. The user will retain his login credentials and 2-factor authentication configuration.

## Creating a separate account for your client

First, you must add another account to your user profile by taking the following steps.

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Visit the settings for your user profile by clicking the <label>Settings</label> link in the dropdown menu.

1. At this point, you will be presented with a form where you should fill in with the details for your new account.

1. Once you've submitted the new account form, the account is created and you are free to activate it by clicking the <label>Select a plan</label>. You may also configure other parts of your account from the top navigation menu before activating your account.

## Inviting your client to DNSimple
  
  Verify with your client that is a __registered__ DNSimple.
  
  If needed, [point your client to the signup page](https://dnsimple.com/signup).
  
  <note>It is not necessary that your client have an active subscription, just that they have already signed up for the service.</note>
