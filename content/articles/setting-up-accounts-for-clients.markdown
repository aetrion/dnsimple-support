<note>
In order to have multiple members on a single account, you must first [be subscribed to an eligible plan](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) for that account.
</note>

Creating a separate account is a flexible and secure way for agencies and freelancers to share domain management with their clients.

Keep in mind that when you add your client as a user to an account, the new member will have full access rights on every resource attached to the account, including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

The member will also have full-admin access to the account, including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. The user will retain his login credentials and 2-factor authentication configuration.

<warning>
Each customer must have a separate account, otherwise if you add more than one customer to the same account each customer will be able to manage other customers' domains.
</warning>
