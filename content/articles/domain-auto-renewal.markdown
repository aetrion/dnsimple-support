The auto-renewal service reduces the risk to let a domain expire by renewing the domain automatically upon expiration. When auto-renewal is turned on for a domain, we'll attempt to renew it automatically prior to the domain's expiration, and we'll bill your credit card if the renewal is successful.

## When does the auto-renewal happen?

Auto-renewal usually occurs within the last 30 days prior to the domain expiration date, and may vary from domain to domain.

You may enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain, or any time after the domain has been registered and before the last 30 days before the domain expires.

<note>
Auto-renewals are processed automatically within the last 30 days prior to the domain expiration. For this reason, enablying the auto-renewal a few days before the expiration is not enough to ensure the domain is automatically renewed and there is an high change that you will lose your domain. Likewise, if want let a domain expire but you turn off auto-renewal just a few days before the expiration, the domain may already be auto-renewed and you will not be able to get a refund for it.

We deliver auto-renewal and expiration starting from 2 months prior to the domain expiration date. Please update your auto-renewals preferences in time before reaching the 30-days zone.

## Enable Auto-Renewal

By default, newly registered domains are set to auto-renew, but if you have turned off auto-renewal and would like to re-enable auto-renewal for your domain, you should follow these steps.

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To enable auto-renewal for a domain

1.  Log into your DNSimple account.
1.  On the top-nav menu click the <label>Domains</label> tab, locate the relevant domain and click on the name to access the domain page.
1.  Check the <label>Auto-renew this domain before it expires</label> checkbox on the registration status card

1.  Auto-renewal is now enabled on your domain!
</div>

## Disable Auto-Renewal

<warning>
Keep in mind that [some registries require that domains renew through auto-renewal](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains/). If you disable auto-renewal for a domain that requires auto-renewal to renew, then you risk losing the domain.
</warning>

If you would like to turn off auto-renewal for a domain, you should follow these steps:

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
