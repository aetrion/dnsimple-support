The auto-renewal service reduces the risk of a domain expiring by renewing the domain automatically within 30 days of expiration. When auto-renewal is turned on for a domain we'll attempt to renew it automatically prior to expiration, and we'll bill your credit card if the renewal is successful.

## When does the auto-renewal happen?

Auto-renewal usually occurs within 30 days prior of the domain's expiration date, as such this figure may vary from domain to domain.

You may enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain, or any time after the domain has been registered. However, it cannot be turned on within 30 days of the expiration date.

<warning>
Auto-renewals are processed automatically within the final 30 days of registration. For this reason, enabling auto-renewal a few days before expiration is not enough to ensure the domain is automatically renewed; increasing the risk that you lose the domain. Likewise, if want to let a domain expire but you turn off auto-renewal just a few days before the expiration, the domain may already be auto-renewed and you will not be able to get a refund for it.

We deliver auto-renewal and expiration notices starting 2 months prior to the domain's expiration date. Please update your auto-renewal preferences before it reaches the 30-days "zone".

## Enable Auto-Renewal

By default, newly registered domains are set to auto-renew, but if you have turned off auto-renewal and would like to re-enable it for your domain, you should follow these steps.

## Disable auto-renewal

<warning>
Keep in mind that [some registries require that domains renew through auto-renewal](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains/). If you disable auto-renewal for a domain that requires auto-renewal to renew, then you risk losing the domain.
