# What is Domain Auto-renewal?

Enabling auto-renewal on a domain will cause that domain to be automatically renewed prior to the domain's expiration.

Auto-renewal usually occurs within the last 30 days prior to the domain expiration date, and may vary from domain to domain.

You may enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain, or any time after the domain has been registered and before the last 30 days before the domain expires.
