# What is Domain Auto-renewal?

[Enabling auto-renewal](/articles/enabling-and-disabling-auto-renewal) on a domain will cause that domain to be automatically renewed prior to the domain's expiration. Auto-renewal usually occurs within the last 30 days prior to the domain expiration date, and may vary from domain to domain.

You may enable auto-renewal when you first register a domain, or any time after the domain has been registered and before the last 30 days before the domain expires.

<note>
Auto-renewals are processed automatically within the last 30 days prior to the domain expiration. For this reason, enablying the auto-renewal a few days before the expiration is not enough to ensure the domain is automatically renewed and there is an high change that you will lose your domain. Likewise, if want let a domain expire but you turn off auto-renewal just a few days before the expiration, the domain may already be auto-renewed and you will not be able to get a refund for it.

We deliver auto-renewal and expiration starting from 2 months prior to the domain expiration date. Please update your auto-renewals preferences in time before reaching the 30-days zone.

If you need guidance on how to enable or disable auto-renewal, take a look at the support article for [enabling and disabling auto-renewal](/articles/enabling-and-disabling-auto-renewal).
