# New Account Page

We listened to your feedback and redesigned the account page to better serve your needs. The new design should feel familiar, yet improve on the different tasks that you usually perform on your account:

1. Update credit card
1. Review and edit invoice information
1. Change subscription plan
1. Invite team members

You can always switch back to the previous account page by clicking on the "Switch back to old design" link below the sidebar menu. If you do this, please take a moment to write to us at support@dnsimple.com and let us know how to improve the new design.

### Table of Contents {#toc}

## Overview

We have simplified the sidebar to include rolling the billing settings into the account menu. Webhooks, API tokens, and applictations can be found under the new _automation_ menu.

## Account email address and name

You can now edit your account name and email address on the first card under the _account_ menu. If you wish to update the email address to login to DNSimple, this is not the email address that you are looking for. Please have a look [at this article](/articles/changing-user-email/)

This new section gives you a detailed breakdown of your account plan and what you are currently paying for. You can switch your plan and your billing cycle (monthly, yearly) from this section.

Activity tracking provides an overview of all past changes for your account as a whole.

## Cancel subscription

Canceling your subscription is the last action under the _account_ menu.

You can cancel your subscription at any time. After unsubscribing you will no longer be charged a monthly/yearly fee and your domains will no longer resolve with us. You may resubscribe at any time and your domains will resolve again.

If you cancel your account, all your domains and records will still remain in your account. You will also be able to transfer your domains out of DNSimple.

## Adding team members

An account can be associated with one or more users. When you add a user to an account, the new user has full access rights on every resource attached to the account: domains, contacts, and SSL certificates.

Members have full admin access, including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. The user will retain their login credentials and 2-factor authentication configuration.

You can invite (or revoke an invitation) under the _team_ menu. Click on the "Invite" link to get started.

In order to have multiple members on a single account, you must first be [subscribed to an eligible plan](https://dnsimple.com/pricing)

## API access token

An account token gives you access to the resources connected to that account: domains, SSL certificates, contacts, etc...

You can manage your API access tokens from the _automation_ menu on your account.

## Webhooks

Under the _automation_ menu, you can manage webhooks for any event related to your account.

Webhooks allow any application that can listen to HTTPS POSTs to receive notification of events as they occur. With webhooks you can now react to events like domain registrations, transfers, renewals, automatic renewals, zone changes, and a whole lot more.

Post announcements in your team's Slack channel. Listen for auto-renewal events and automatically handle billing your customers for those renewals. These are just a few examples of how you can use Webhooks to create better integrations with DNSimple and make your domains simpler to operate and grow.
