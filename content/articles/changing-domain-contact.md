# Changing domain contacts

*You will only be able to make these changes if the domain is registered with DNSimple. If you are only hosting the domain with us you will have to transfer it in before being able to make them. Otherwise you will have to handle the contact in formation on your current registrar.*



## Changing a domain's contact completely

If you want to assign a new contact to one of your domains the first thing you should do is create it. Go to the contact management using the top menu link. Then click *Add a contact*:

A form where you can introduce all the contact's information will be displayed. Fill it in and click *Add contact*.

Once you have created the contact that you want to change the domain to go to your domain's management page. You can get there using the top menu *Domains* link. Locate your domain and use the *Manage* button:

On the right hand side of the page you will see several actions you can perform on your domain under the *Tasks* section. Click on the *Change Contacts* link.

Now you will see a list of all your existing contacts with the one that is currently assigned to the domain selected. All you need to do is choose the contact that you have just created and save the changes. We will update the data in the registry so the WHOIS of the domain reflects them.



## Changing an existing contact's data

If you want to change part of an existing contact's data you will have to access the contact management page from the top menu. Once you are there all your existing contacts will be listed. Once you have located the one whose information you want to change click *Edit*:

![Edit contact data](http://cl.ly/Uqum/edit-existing-contact-1.jpg)

All the information about the contact will be displayed in a form so you can modify it. Once the changes are saved we will update the data in the registry so the WHOIS of the domain reflects them.
