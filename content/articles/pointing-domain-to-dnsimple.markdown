# Pointing a Domain to DNSimple

## The domain is registered with DNSimple

If you register your domain with DNSimple then it will automatically use our Anycast name servers.

If you transferred your domain to DNSimple or if you have previously used other name servers, then go to your domain's Manage page and click the link Switch to DNSimple if you are not already using our name servers.

## The domain is registered with another provider

Follow these instructions to [delegate a domain registered with another registrar to DNSimple](http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/delegating-dnsimple-hosted).

## Name server propagation

Please note that it may take up to 24 hours for a name server change to propagate. The whois response is normally a good way to [determine if the changes have been submitted properly](/articles/domain-resolution-issues).
