# DNS Hosting

DNSimple provides robust DNS hosting using a [global Anycast network](/articles/anycast/).

If you want to use DNSimple to manage the DNS of an existing domain, you have two options:

1.  **Keep the domain registration at your current registrar and just transfer the DNS management to us.**

    If you simply want to use DNSimple to host your DNS for a domain, then follow these instructions to [point your doman to our name servers](/articles/delegating-dnsimple-hosted/).

1.  **Transfer the domain registration and DNS management to us.**

    If you want DNSimple to act as your domain registrar, then follow these instructions to [transfer your domain to DNSimple](/articles/transferring-domain/).
