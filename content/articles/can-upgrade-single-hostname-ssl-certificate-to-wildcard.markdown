# Can I upgrade a single-hostname SSL certificate to a wildcard SSL certificate?

No. It's currently not possible to upgrade a single-hostname SSL certificate to a wildcard certificate, even if they are issued by the same Certificate Authority.

However, if the single-hostname SSL certificate was purchased within 30 days we can refund the order so that you will not have to pay for two different certificates.
