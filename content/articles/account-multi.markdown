DNSimple allows an user to be associated with multiple accounts. This may happen in two cases:

- The user is [added as a member to an existing account](/articles/account-users)
- The user created a new account

Managing multiple account is a flexible way to access different level of service and share domain management with other users.


## Creating a separate account #{creating}

If you would like to add another account to your user profile, you should take the following steps.

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Visit the settings for your user profile by clicking the <label>Settings</label> link in the dropdown menu.

1. Once you've submitted the new account form, the account will have been created and you will be free to activate your account by clicking the <label>Select a plan</label> or configure your other parts of your account from the top navigation menu before activating your account.

## Switching active accounts

Switching account context is very simple. All you must do is select the account you'd like to use from the dropdown menu.
