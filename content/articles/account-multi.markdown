DNSimple allows a user to be associated with multiple accounts. This may happen in two cases:

- The user is [added as a member to an existing account](/articles/account-users)
- The user created a new account

Managing multiple accounts is a flexible way to access different levels of service and share domain management with other users.


## Creating a separate account #{creating}

If you would like to add another account to your user profile, you should take the following steps.

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Visit the settings for your user profile by clicking the <label>Settings</label> link in the dropdown menu.

1. Once there, you follow the <label>Add new account</label> link.

1. At this point, you will be presented with a form where you should fill in with the details for your new account.

1. Once you've submitted the new account form, the account is created and you are free to activate it by clicking the <label>Select a plan</label>. You may also configure other parts of your account from the top navigation menu before activating your account.

## Switching active accounts

Switching account context is very simple. Select the account you'd like to use from the dropdown menu.

Once you've done that you can verify that your active account has changed by clicking the dropdown menu again.
