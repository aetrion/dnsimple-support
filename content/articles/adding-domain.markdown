# Adding a Domain

When adding a domain to your account, you can choose to register a new domain, transfer an existing domain you own from another registrar, or just use our DNS service if the domain is already registered with another registrar and you'd like to keep it there.

Regardless of which option you use, the steps outlined above will have successfully walked you through the process of adding a domain to DNSimple.
