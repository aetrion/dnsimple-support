# Moving domains between DNSimple accounts

DNSimple allows a domain to be used only once system-wide.

To move a domain to another DNSimple account use the *push* feature.

On DNSimple "Manage" your domain and click "Move Within DNSimple" under the "Tasks" section. Enter a destination email address of another DNSimple account. Please be certain that the email address you enter matches the correct account. Once the domain is moved you will no longer be able to control this domain under your current account.

The domain will be moved along with all of its records and SSL certificates.
