# Moving domains

You can move (*push*) a domain between DNSimple accounts at any time via the DNSimple interface. Billing responsability will be transferred to the new domain account, once the move is accepted. Moving a domain to another account will also transfer all the associated resources, such as DNS records, SSL certificates and email forwards.

<note>
Once the push is accepted, you will no longer be able to manage the domain.

## Initiate move

To move a domain to another DNSimple account, go to the domain's management page, click on the Admin tab and then follow the "Transfer ownership" link.

Enter a destination email address of another DNSimple account. Please be certain that the email address you enter matches the correct account. Once the domain is moved you will no longer be able to control this domain under your current account.
