# Email Forwarding

Email forwarding can be enabled on a domain-by-domain basis. The cost is $2 per month per domain for up to 1000 messages delivered.

## Enabling email forwarding

To enable email forwarding visit a domain's manage page and follow the **Email Forwarding** link under **Tasks**.

Create an email forward to enable the service.

When you enable email forwarding we will automatically add the various DNS records needed to support forwarding.

## Creating an email forward

To create an email forward you need to specify the **From** and **To** fields.

The **From** field is used to match an email address to forward from. Enter either a specific name (such as "support") without the domain. 

To create a catch-all address use a wildcard expression which is a period followed by an asterisk `(.*)`.

In the **To** field enter the email address you would like as the recipient of the email. You can use a Gmail address or any other email address.

**Note:** when you use email forwarding on a domain you cannot use any other email service providers (such as Google Apps).
