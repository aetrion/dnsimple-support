# The Name DNSimple

Our goal has always been to simplify DNS, so DNSimple is a portmantou of the abbrevation for Domain Name System (DNS) and the English word Simple.

But pronoucing it isn't always simple.

Here's a basic guide:

## Pronouncing DNSimple

The easiest way to visualize it is D-N-Simple.

Here at DNSimple we love sharing, that's why DNS and Simple share the "S".
