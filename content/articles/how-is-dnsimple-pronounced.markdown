# The Name DNSimple

DNSimple is a portmantou of the abbrevation for Domain Name System (DNS) and the English word Simple, because our goal has always been to try to make DNS more Simple.
However pronoucing it is not always simple.
Here is a basic guide.

## Pronouncing DNSimple

The easiest way to visualize it is D-N-Simple.
Here at DNSimple we love sharing, that's why DNS and Simple share the "S".

The phonetic form is dee-en-sim-puhl.

DNS-Simple is close but not correct.
DNS-imple is right out.
