This article describes both the *Personal* plan and the *Professional* plan, and the differences between each. Our Professional plan helps you to protect and secure your customers, your team, and your business.

## Can I work with other people on my account?

**Personal:** No! While it may be a clever trick, sharing login credentials is an unprofessional security risk.

**Professional:** Yes! You will be able to invite others to help manage your domains. Also included is your full activity log, which provides 100% transparency into account and domain changes.

## Are my customers protected when they visit my site?

**Personal:** ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

**Professional:** Yes! You'll be saving time and money with our Wildcard Let's Encrypt certificates, as well as our HTTPS redirector (to forward all non-HTTPS traffic to a secured connection).

## Can I customize my invoice email?

**Personal:** Absolutely not! Your invoice is only sent to you.

**Professional:** Yes! On our Professional plan, you can have your invoices sent directly to your accountant, bookkeeper, or anyone else.

## How fast can I get help from the experts?

**Personal:** A watching-paint-dry 24 hours.

**Professional:** Faster than 24 hours!

## Do I have access to the DNSimple Slack app?

**Personal:** No! You're missing out on the easiest way to manage your domains.

**Professional:** Yes! Using our Slack app, you can buy, connect, and operate your domains directly from your Slack channel.

## Am I covered by an SLA?

**Personal:** No! Fingers crossed...

**Professional:** Yes! We have a 99% SLA on our Professional plan.
