## Can I redirect for HTTPS?

**Personal:** No. Redirect your users *only* using HTTP redirects.

**Professional:** Yes! Safely redirect all non-HTTPS traffic to a secured connection.

## Can I work with other people on my account?

**Personal:** No! While it may be a clever trick, sharing login credentials is an unprofessional security risk.

**Professional:** Yes! You'll be saving time and money with our Wildcard Let's Encrypt certificates.

## How fast can I get help from the experts?

**Personal:** A watching-paint-dry 24 hours.

**Professional:** Get *fast* help from developers.

## Can I customize my invoice email?

**Personal:** No, invoices are only sent to the account owner.

**Professional:** Yes! On our Professional plan, your invoices can be sent directly to your accountant, bookkeeper, or anyone else.

## Do I have access to the DNSimple Slack app?

**Personal:** No! You're missing out on the easiest way to manage your domains.
