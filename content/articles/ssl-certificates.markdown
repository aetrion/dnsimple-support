# SSL Certificates

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a security protocol designed to secure the communication between a server and a client, for example a web server and a browser.

An SSL certificate is required to enable SSL on your site and use the HTTPS protocol.

We offer [two types of SSL certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates-types/) signed by [globally recognized certificate authorities](/articles/what-ssl-certificate-authorities/).
