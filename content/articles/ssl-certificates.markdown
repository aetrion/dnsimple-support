# SSL Certificates

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a security protocol designed to secure the communication between a server and a client, for example a web server and a browser.

An SSL certificate is required to enable SSL on your site and use the HTTPS protocol.

DNSimple offers [two types of SSL certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates-types/) signed by globally recognized [certificate authorities (CAs)](/articles/what-is-a-certificate-authority).


## Supported Certificate Types

We currently provide:

- Single-name SSL certificates from RapidSSL
- Wildcard SSL certificates from Comodo

All these certificates are domain-validated.

### Single-name SSL certificates from RapidSSL

The RapidSSL certificate is a domain-validated, single-name certificate.

This SSL certificate costs $20 per year and covers one host and the root domain in case of the www hostname.

### Wildcard SSL certificates from Comodo

The Comodo Essential certificate is a domain-validated, wildcard certificate.

This SSL certificate costs $100 per year and covers all single-level subdomains as well as the root domain.

### Organization Validated and Extended Validation certificates

We currently don't provide organization-validated and extended-validation certificates.
