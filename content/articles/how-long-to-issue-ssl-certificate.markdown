# How long does it take to issue an SSL certificate?

The time required to issue a new [SSL certificate](/articles/ssl-certificates/) depends on many factors. The SSL certificate type, the validation process, and how quickly you respond with requested information from us or the [certificate authority](/articles/what-is-a-certificate-authority/) communications.

In general, issuing a new domain-validated SSL certificate can take from a few minutes to a few hours, **after you [approve the SSL certificate](/articles/ssl-certificates-email-approval/)**.

<warning>
#### Remember to approve the certificate!

In most cases, the purchase process can get stuck because the certificate is never approved by the owner. Once you submit the certificate, please monitor the approval email inbox and make sure to **click on the link contained in the email sent from the Certificate Authority** in order to validate and approve the certificate. Be sure to monitor your spam folder in case these emails are accidentally marked as spam.
