# Changing domain contacts

You can change the contact associated to a domain registered with DNSimple at any time.

<note>
#### Domain Not Registered with DNSimple

The following instructions apply only to a domain registered with DNSimple. If you are hosting the domain with us but the domain is registered elsewhere, you will have to transfer it or update the contact information at your current registrar.

## Changing a domain's contact completely

If you want to assign a new contact to one of your domains, the first thing you should do is create it. Go to the contact manager using the top menu link. Then click *Add a contact*:

A form where you can introduce all the contact's information is displayed. Fill it in and click *Add contact*.

Once you have created the contact that you want to change the domain, go to your domain's management page. You can get there using the top menu *Domains* link. Locate your domain and click the *Manage* button:

On the right hand side of the page you will see several actions you can perform on your domain under the *Tasks* section. Click on the *Change Contacts* link.

Now you will see a list of all your existing contacts, with the one that is currently assigned to the domain selected. Choose the contact that you have just created and save the changes. We will update the data in the registry so the WHOIS of the domain reflects the new contact information.



## Changing an existing contact's data

If you want to change part of an existing contact's data, you will have to access the contact management page from the top menu. Once you are there, all your existing contacts are listed. Once you have located the one whose information you want to change, click *Edit*:

![Edit contact data](http://cl.ly/Uqum/edit-existing-contact-1.jpg)

All the information about the contact is displayed in a form so you can modify it. Once the changes are saved we will update the data in the registry so the WHOIS of the domain reflects them.
