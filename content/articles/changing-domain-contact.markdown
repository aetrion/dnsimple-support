# Changing domain contacts

You can change the contact associated to a domain registered with DNSimple at any time.

<note>
#### Domain Not Registered with DNSimple

The following instructions apply only to a domain registered with DNSimple. If you are hosting the domain with us but the domain is registered elsewhere, you will have to transfer it or update the contact information at your current registrar.
