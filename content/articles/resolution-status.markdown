# Resolution Status

The resolution status component in the domain page shows if the domain is currently resolving with [DNSimple name servers](/articles/dnsimple-nameservers).

The indicator is based on the [Is It DNSimple?](http://isitdnsimple.com/) service and displays real-time results. When you load the page, the indicator fetches the current name servers for the domains and compares them with DNSimple name servers.

You can click on the refresh button to refresh the indicator without reloading the page.

## Domain is Resolving

Well done! The domain is resolving with our name servers. You can manage the domain records from the DNSimple advanced editor.

## Domain is not Resolving

If the domain is not resolving correctly, the indicator will tell you how to point the domain to DNSimple.

Don't forget to read the [domain resolution issues](/articles/domain-resolution-issues) article, it contains some common causes that prevent the domain to resolve correctly.

### Domain registered with DNSimple

If the domain is registered with DNSimple, the indicator will provide a link to [switch to DNSimple name servers](/articles/pointing-domain-to-dnsimple).

If you registered the domain with us, we will set the name servers automatically. If you transferred the domain to us, please note we don't automatically switch your name servers and you will need to follow the link to point the domain to DNSimple.

### Domain registered with other registrar
