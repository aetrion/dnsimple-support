In June 2015 [we released one of our largest upgrade to our platform](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2015/06/multiple-accounts-new-plans-and-new-features/), that introduced several new features  like multiple accounts, teams, and regional records. With the release of the multi-account feature, we also changed our plan structure.

This article explains the main differences between the pre-2015 plans and current plans.


## Legacy plans

Before the current plans, we had two generations of domain-based plans. They shared the same names, but were priced differently.

First-generation legacy plans:

- Bronze v1
- Silver v1
- Gold v1
- Platinum v1

Second-generation legacy plans (introduced in 2014):

- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum


## Current plans

Current plans are:

- Personal
- Professional
- Business

We also have corresponding reseller plans:

- Basic Reseller
- Expert Reseller
- Master Reseller


## Identify the plan type

You can check your plan type from your account page. It's immediately visible on the main account page â€“ just select the account you want to check.

If you're using a legacy plan, a yellow banner will  appear at the top of screen.

## Current plans vs Legacy plans

The main difference between legacy plans and current plans is the structure. With legacy plans, we charged you based on how many domains you had in your account. Now, [our plans](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) are based on the features you need. 

The Personal plan is our most affordable offering, and includes the features necessary for a single person. The Professional and Business plans include features organizations commonly request, like multi-user accounts and the ability to configure different billing addresses.

Plans no longer have domain limits. So even if you have more domains than average on the Personal plan, you won't have to upgrade to a more expensive plan just to add more. You can stay on the plan that has the features you need, and add as many domains you want.

Each plan includes five domains. We charge a small fee per domain for extra domains, based on the plan. If you have a substantial number of domains, you should consider one of our [reseller plans](https://dnsimple.com/reseller). Reseller plans have a higher monthly cost compared to standard plans, but they have a larger discount on the price-per-domain.

We've written a few articles to clarify the difference between old plans and current plans:

- [I'm a Bronze customer](/articles/new-plans-for-bronze)
- [I'm a Silver customer](/articles/new-plans-for-silver)
- [I'm a Gold customer](/articles/new-plans-for-gold)

## Price differences

In most cases, the price for current plans is similar to the price of second-generation legacy plans. Depending on the number of domains in your account, current plans may even be less expensive.

Compared to first-generation legacy plans, some customers may notice a larger price increase (especially Gold v1). We introduced first-generation plans in 2010 when DNSimple's infrastructure was simpler and less expensive to maintain.

Over the last six years we've invested heavily in DDoS protection, Anycast DNS, and additional infrastructure.  We continue working to provide advanced features, like easy-to-use SSL certificates and Secondary DNS. Our current plans improve the service for all our customers, and help DNSimple grow .

## Features only on current plans {#newer-plans-only}

Many features are only made available on [current plans](#newer-plans) -  Personal, Professional, Business, and Reseller plans

If you see a _newer plan warning_ banner at the top of a support article, it means your account must be subscribed to one of the current plans in order to use the feature. If you're using a legacy plan, such as Bronze, Silver, or Gold, you can upgrade to the appropriate plan, and the feature will immediately be available to you.

## Features only on certain tiers of current plans {#newer-plans-some}

Some features are only available on certain plans, based on the level of service. For example, teams and regional records are features that make sense in an organizational context, so they're only available on Professional and Business plans.

If you see a _some-plans warning_ banner at the top of a support article, make sure your account is subscribed to the correct plan for that feature.

Some advanced features are only available in higher-tier plans. If you need the feature on a limited number of domains, you may want to [use multiple accounts to segment the business](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2015/12/using-accounts-to-segment-business/).

For example, if you need [vanity name servers](/articles/vanity-nameservers) only on 3-4 domains, create a separate account with these domains, and subscribe  it to the Business plan. Leave the other domains on a lower plan, such as Professional, and you'll only pay the for the feature on domains where you actually use it.
