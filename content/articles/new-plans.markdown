In June 2015 [we released one of our largest upgrade to our platform](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2015/06/multiple-accounts-new-plans-and-new-features/), that introduced several new features such as multiple accounts, teams, and regional records. With the release of the multi-account feature we also changed our plans structure.

This article explains the main differences between the pre-2015 plan types and the new types.


## Legacy plans

Before the new plans, we had two generation of domain-based plans. They were called in the same way, but they were priced a little bit different.

First-generation legacy plans are:

- Bronze v1
- Silver v1
- Gold v1
- Platinum v1

Second-generation legacy plans (introduced in 2014) and are:

- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum


## Newer plans

Newer plans are:

- Personal
- Professional
- Business

We also have corresponding reseller plans:

- Basic Reseller
- Expert Reseller
- Master Reseller


## Identify the plan type

You can check the plan from your account page. From the account switcher on the top-right of your page, select the account you want to check.

The plan type is immediately visible in the main account page.

If you are using a legacy plan, a yellow banner will also appear at the top of screen.

## Newer plans vs Legacy plans

The main different between legacy plans and old plans is the way plans are structured. The legacy plans were strongly based on the number of domains, and you were charged depending on how many domains you had in your account.

[The new plans](https://dnsimple.com/pricing), instead, are based on service offering: the price changes based on the types of features you need. For example, the Personal plan is now our cheapest offering and doesn't include the ability to share the account with other members as we assume you don't need it in a personal plan. Conversely, Professional and Business plans includes features generally requested by organizations such as the ability to share the account with multiple members, or the ability to configure a different billing address.

Newer plans no longer have domain limits. This means that even if you are a Personal user with a number of domain larger than the average, you no longer need to upgrade to a more expensive plan just to add more domains. You can stay on the plan that most represent your profile, and add as many domains you want.

Newer plans include 5 domains. For any extra domain we charge a small extra fee, based on the plan. If you have a very large number of domains, you may consider one of our [reseller plans](https://dnsimple.com/reseller). Reseller plans have an higher monthly cost compared to standard plans, but they have a substantial discount on the price-per-domain.

We also created 4 specific articles:

- [I'm a Bronze customer](/articles/new-plans-for-bronze)
- [I'm a Silver customer](/articles/new-plans-for-silver)
- [I'm a Gold customer](/articles/new-plans-for-gold)
- [I'm a Platinum customer](/articles/new-plans-for-platinum)


## Price differences

In most cased, the price for newer plans is generally close to the price of second-generation legacy plans. Depending on the number of domains you had, newer plans can actually be cheaper (this is the case for several Silver accounts with less than 6 domains) or more expensiver in the order of a few dollars per month.

When compared to first-generation legacy plans, some customers may notice a larger price increase (especially Gold v1). First-generation plans were introduced in 2010, when the DNSimple infrastructure was an order of magniture simpler (and cheaper to maintain) than today.

In the last years we invested in DDoS protection, Anycast DNS, infrastructure, and we worked to provide advanced features such as easy-to-use SSL certificates and Secondary DNS. Newer plans will continue to help us growing and improve our service offering.


## Newer plans-only features {#newer-plans-only}

New features are, generally, only rolled out to [newer plans](#newer-plans): Personal, Professional, Business, and resellers.

If you see a _newer plan warning_ banner at the top of a support article, it means your account must be subscribed to one of these plans in order to use the feature. If you are using a legacy plan such as Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum, you can upgrade to the most appropriate plan, and the feature will be immediately available to you.


## Newer plans-only plan features {#newer-plans-some}

Some features are only available on certain new plans, based on the level of service. For example, teams and regional records are feature that generally makes sense only in the context of an organizations, therefore they are available only to Professional and Business plans.

If you see a _some-plans warning_ banner at the top of a support article, make sure your account is subscribed to the appropriate plan in order to use that feature.

Some advanced features are only available in higher plans. It's also worth to mention that, if you need the feature only on a limited number of domains, you may want to consider [using multiple accounts to segment the business](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2015/12/using-accounts-to-segment-business/).

For example, if you need [vanity name servers](/articles/vanity-nameservers) only on 3-4 domains, create a separate account with only these domains, and subscribe it to the Business plan. Leave the other domains on a lower plan, such as Professional, and you will only pay the feature for the domains where you actually use it.
