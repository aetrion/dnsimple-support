# Expiring Product Email Notifications

DNSimple monitors the expiration date of your products and sends you an email notification when they are at risk of expiring.

The following products are currently monitored:

- Purchased domains
- Purchased certificates
- Purchased whois privacies

As soon as one of these products enters in the 60-day expiration period, we start delivering you an email notification.

There are two types of expiring domain notifications:

- [Product Expiration](/articles/product-expiration-notification) - A digest email containing the list of products expiring within 2 months. Delivered every week, if you have expiring products.
- [Product Expiring Tomorrow](/articles/product-expiring-tomorrow-notification) - A final reminder containing the list of products expiring in less than 24 hours. Delivered once, the day before the expiration date.

The notifications are delivered to the email address associated to your account.

<note>
ICANN also sends required notifications more frequently about domains registered with us. These notifications will be sent to the registrant email address for the domain and cannot be disabled.
</note>

## Disabling Expiration Notifications

We provide the ability to [disable expiration notifications on domains that are not set to auto-renew](/articles/disabling-expiration-notifications). At this time there is no way to disable other notifications.
