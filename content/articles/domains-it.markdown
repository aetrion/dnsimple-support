This article explains the requirements for .IT domain names.

## Requirements

To register an .IT (Italy) domain you must meet one of the following criteria:

1. In possession of the citizenship or resident in a country belonging to the European Union (in the case of registration for natural persons)
1. Established in a country belonging to the European Union (in the case of registration for other organizations)

Please make sure the Registrant contact you associate to the domain during the registration meets this requirement, otherwise the registration will be rejected by the registry.
