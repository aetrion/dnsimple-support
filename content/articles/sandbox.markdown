# Sandbox for Testing Calls to the API

DNSimple maintains an isolated test site at [sandbox.dnsimple.com](https://sandbox.dnsimple.com/). Please feel free to test your experience and any application code that integrates with the DNSimple API here.

This site is generally an exact duplicate of the production application. Instead of actually performing domain registration, charging credit cards, etc. it mocks these functions.

To test mock registration features you will have to create a test account. Enter "1" for all the numbered credit card fields to activate your test account.
