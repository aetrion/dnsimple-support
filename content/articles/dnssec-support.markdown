## DS Records

We currently support adding DS records for DNSSEC-enabled zones hosted elsewhere. You may read more on our [blog post](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2015/11/ds-records-for-dnssec/) announcing support.

We support adding DS records for the following TLDs:

- com
- net
- info

We will continue to add additional TLD support over time.

## DNSSEC Extensions for DNS Zones

We do not support the DNSSEC extensions for DNS zones in our authoritative name servers.

We are planning on adding DNSSEC support in the future but do not currently have a specific timeline for when we would begin supporting it.
