Either monthly or yearly (depending on the option you chose when you purchased your subscription), you will receive an email that includes your invoice. You will also receive an invoice for [one-time charges](#one-time-charges) such as domain registrations. [Learn how to find and view your invoice history](/articles/account-invoice-history/).

## Charge types

DNSimple has both recurring charges and one-time charges. One-time charges, such as the fees you pay for registering a domain or for purchasing a Standard or Wildcard SSL certificate, appear on a separate invoice than the fees for your subscription. Such charges _can_ be recurring if you've enabled auto-renewal for the product.

### Recurring charges

- DNSimple subscription
- Email forwards
- Extra domain zones

### One-time charges

<info>
Domain renewal charges will be recurring if you have enabled [auto-renewal](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/).
</info>

- Domain registrations, transfers, and renewals
- Standard or Wildcard SSL certificates
- Whois Privacy

## Proration

```
I'm digging through the code trying to see how proration is calculated. Javier may be able to offer some color here.
```

When you change your plan you will receive a proration discount corresponding to the remaining days in your current subscription plan. This discount does not consider extras, like email forwards or extra zones, which you will be billed for again as part of the plan change.
