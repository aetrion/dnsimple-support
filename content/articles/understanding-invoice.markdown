You will receive invoices by email for various charges incurred throughout your billing cycle, like your DNSimple subscription renewal, domain registrations, certificates and other [one-time charges](#one-time-charges).

Here is closer look at what your invoice means:

![DNSimple invoice](/files/dnsimple-invoice.png)

1. We are DNSimple. We are focused on providing [effortless domain and DNS management](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/dnsimple-services/).
2. **Invoice Number**
  - The unique number assigned to your invoice.
3. **Invoice Date**
  - The date the invoice was created. The invoice date is the day of the start of your billing cycle. For example, if your billing cycle is Jan 15 - Feb 14, your Invoice Date is Jan 15.
4. **Terms**
  - Indicates whether your invoice is `Due Upon Receipt`, `Open`, or `Paid`.
5. **To**
  - Your company name and address. To update this information, see [Billing Settings](/articles/billing-settings/).
6. **Your Order**
  - This section gives an itemized listing of your [charges](#charge-types) (subscriptions or products) for the invoice.
7. **Subtotal**
  - The total amount for the invoice before any credits or discounts.
8. **Credit**
  - The amount of any credit deducted from your [account credit balance](/articles/account-subscription-balance/).
9. **Total**
  - The amount due for the invoice billing cycle.

## Charge types

DNSimple has both recurring charges and one-time charges. One-time charges, such as the fees you pay for registering a domain or for purchasing a Standard or Wildcard SSL certificate, appear on a separate invoice than the fees for your subscription. Such charges _can_ be recurring if you've enabled auto-renewal for the product.

### Recurring charges

- DNSimple subscription
- Email forwards
- Extra domain zones

### One-time charges

<info>
Domain renewal charges can be recurring if you have enabled [auto-renewal](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/).
</info>

- Domain registrations, transfers, and renewals
- Standard or Wildcard SSL certificates
- Whois Privacy

## Proration

```
I'm digging through the code trying to see how proration is calculated. Javier may be able to offer some color here.
```

When you change your plan you will receive a proration discount corresponding to the remaining days in your current subscription plan. This discount does not consider extras, like email forwards or extra zones, which you will be billed for again as part of the plan change.
