## Charge types

DNSimple has both recurring charges and one-time charges. One-time charges, such as the fees you pay for registering a domain or for purchasing a Standard or Wildcard SSL certificate, appear on a separate invoice than the fees for your subscription. Such charges _can_ be recurring, such as if you've enabled auto-renewal for a domain.

### Recurring charges

- DNSimple subscription
- [Email forwards](/articles/email-forwarding/)
- [Extra domain zones](/articles/dns-hosting/#extra-zones)

![Recurring charges](/files/recurring-charges.png)

### One-time charges

<info>
Domain registration charges can be recurring if you have enabled [auto-renewal](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/).
</info>

- Domain registrations
- Domain renewals
- Domain transfers
- Standard or Wildcard SSL certificates
- Whois Privacy


## Proration

When you change your plan you will receive a proration discount corresponding to the remaining days in your current subscription plan. This discount does not consider extras, like email forwards or extra zones, which you will be billed for again as part of the plan change.
