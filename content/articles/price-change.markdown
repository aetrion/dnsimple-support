# Price Change

Since the beginning of DNSimple we've stuck to our original price plans while working hard to bring you innovative DNS and domain services. After three years of business we have decided to raise our prices on our Silver plans to $8 per month and our Gold plans to $18 per month. Yearly pricing will also increase proportionately, however when you switch to yearly billing you will now get two months for free (twelve months for the price of ten). Thus Silver plan will be $80 when pre-paid for one year and the Gold plan will be $180 when pre-paid for one year. This new pricing will go into effect July 1st, 2013.

## I've been a customer for a long time, will my prices go up?

If you already have a DNSimple account your prices will not be changed unless you change plans. If you switch to another plan or change to yearly billing then your account will be changed to the new pricing plan.

## Are domain registration or certificate prices changing?

Currently only DNS hosting prices are changing - we are not changing the prices for domain registrations, transfers and renewals nor are we changing certificate prices.

## Why are you raising your prices?

We have always worked hard to provide the best services and customer support for you, and raising our prices will help us to continue to improve across the board and bring you better, more solid DNS services going forward. We will eventually migrate all customers to our new Anycast network to bring higher performance and reliability to everyone.

## This is totally unfair, who can I talk to?
