# Requesting a Transfer Code

To request a transfer code to transfer a domain out of DNSimple, go to your domain's management page:

![Go to domain's manage page](http://cl.ly/VZlC/get-transfer-code1.jpg)

Once there click on the **Transfer Out** link in the **Tasks** section:

![Find transfer out link](http://cl.ly/VayY/get-transfer-code2.jpg)

This will unlock the domain and email a transfer code to the domain registrant.

If you have requested a domain transfer out and have not received a code then please contact support@dnsimple.com  and include your domain name in the email.

We'll be happy to look into it and figure out why the code has not yet arrived.
