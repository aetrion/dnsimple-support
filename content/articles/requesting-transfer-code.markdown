# Requesting a Transfer Code

To request a transfer code to transfer a domain out of DNSimple, go to your domain's Manage page and click on the Transfer Out link in the Tasks section. This will unlock the domain and email a transfer code to the domain registrant.

If you have requested a domain transfer out and have not received a code then please contact support@dnsimple.com  and include your domain name in the email.

We'll be happy to look into it and figure out why the code has not yet arrived.
