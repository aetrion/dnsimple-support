# Requesting a Transfer Code

The transfer code (also "Authorization Code", "Auth Code") is a code required to authorize the transfer of a domain name. The use of a transfer code is a common procedure for most of TLDs, including all the gTLDs such as `.COM`, `.NET`, `.ORG`.

##### To request a transfer code

1.  Log into your DNSimple account.
1.  Find your domain by searching, you can use the search bar on the dashboard, or the one located at the top of the page in the navbar, as illustrated below. Once you've found the domain you're looking for, click on it to go to the domain page.

    This will unlock the domain and email a transfer code to the domain registrant.

If you have requested a domain transfer out and have not received a code then please [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact) and include your domain name in the email. We'll be happy to look into it and figure out why the code has not yet arrived.
