# Requesting a Transfer Code

The transfer code (also "Authorization Code", "Auth Code") is a code required to authorize the transfer of a domain name. The use of a transfer code is a common procedure for most of TLDs, including all the gTLDs such as `.COM`, `.NET`, `.ORG`.

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To request a transfer code

1.  Log into your DNSimple account.
1.  On the top-nav menu click the <label>Domains</label> tab, locate the relevant domain and click on the name to access the domain page.

1.  Go to the registration section and click <label>Transfer Out</label>

    This will unlock the domain and email a transfer code to the domain registrant.

If you have requested a domain transfer out and have not received a code then please [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact) and include your domain name in the email. We'll be happy to look into it and figure out why the code has not yet arrived.
