# Resending an SSL Certificate Approval Email

If you haven't received the SSL Certificate approval email, for example because the email configuration was incorrect at the time of the submission, you can request the email to be resent.

<div class="steps" markdown="1">
##### To resend the approval email

1.  Log into your DNSimple account.
1.  On the top-nav menu click the <label>Domains</label> tab, locate the relevant domain and click on the name to access the domain page.
1.  Scroll down to the <label>Active SSL Certificate</label> list and click on the certificate.

    If the link is not present, it means the certificate is in a status where the email cannot be resent (e.g. a not submitted or expired certificate).

1.  Click the link and follow the procedure described in the page. Depending on the certificate authority, you will either be able to resend the email directly from the interface or you will be asked to contact the [CA](/articles/what-is-a-certificate-authority) support team for additional assistance.
