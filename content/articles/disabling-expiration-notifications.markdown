# Disabling Expiration Notifications

Provided you have disabled auto-renewal on the domain you hope to let expire, you can simply click the <label>Disable Expiration Notifications</label> link which appears on the card showing registration status of your domain management page of non-auto-renewing domains.

Be careful with this feature as you will not get any notifications of expiration of domains for which you disable these notifications.
