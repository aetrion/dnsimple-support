[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. With DNSimple one-click [DNS services](/categories/services/) you can set up the DNS records required by Heroku using the one-click service we provide.


## Enabling Heroku service

From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update and then click on the DNS tab. Then scroll down to locate the One Click Services section, and select "Manage services".
