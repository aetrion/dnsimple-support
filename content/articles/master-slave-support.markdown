# Master/Slave DNS Support

At this point, DNSimple may only be used as a DNS master and does not support being configured as a secondary provider for a different master DNS provider.

Please see our [secondary DNS article](/articles/secondary-dns) for information on how to set up DNSimple to act as a master DNS server.
