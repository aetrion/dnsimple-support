# Master/Slave DNS Support 

Currently DNSimple does not provide zone transfers in order for you to run your own DNS servers using DNSimple as a front-end.

If you are interested in having this functionality in a future version of DNSimple, please let us know by sending an email to support@dnsimple.com.
