# Account Activation

In order to register or transfer domain names through DNSimple, or to provide DNS resolution, you must activate your DNSimple account.

Activation is easy and includes a free 30 day trial. You can cancel at any time during your 30 day trial without being charged.

To activate your account log in and click on *Activate Your Account*. Choose the plan that fits your needs by clicking on the *Choose Plan* button below the plan. Finally, enter your credit card information and click *Start My Free Trial*.

Your account is now active. Any domains that you update to use our name servers will now resolve with the DNSimple system.
