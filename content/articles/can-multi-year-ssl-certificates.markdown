# Can I purchase an SSL certificate for more than one year?

<note>
This article describes a feature that is only available to the [new plans](/articles/new-plans#new-plans-only).
</note>

Yes! It's possible to purchase a multi-year SSL certificate. You can select the number of years when [purchasing](/articles/purchasing-ssl-certificates) or [renewing](/articles/renewing-ssl-certificate) the SSL certificate.

Note that if you order a certificate for more than one year, the final price will be the certificate price multiplied by the number of years. We currently do not allow the purchase of a certificate for more than 3 years.
