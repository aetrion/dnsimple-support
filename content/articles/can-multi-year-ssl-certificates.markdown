# Can I purchase an SSL certificate for more than one year?

Since August 14, 2020, it's no longer possible to purchase certificates for a period longer than one year. [As explained in this article](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2020/08/ssl-certificates-1-year/), with the ballot SC31 the CA/B forum has effectively prohibited Certificate Authorities to issues certificates valid for more than 397 days, with effective date September 1, 2020.

Please note that this is an industry-standard requirement, and applies to any certificate authority or reseller, and not just to DNSimple.
