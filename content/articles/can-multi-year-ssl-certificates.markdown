# Can I purchase an SSL certificate for more than one year?

<info>
This article describes a feature that is only available to the [new plans](/articles/new-plans#newer-plans-only).
</info>

Yes! It's currently possible to purchase a multi-year SSL certificate, up to August 13, 2020 23:59 UTC (see below for upcoming changes). You can select the number of years when [purchasing](/articles/ordering-standard-certificate) or [renewing](/articles/renewing-ssl-certificate) the SSL certificate.

If you order a certificate for more than one year, the final price will be the certificate price multiplied by the number of years.

## Important information about certificate lifetime

- We do not allow the purchase of a certificate for more than 2 years (as [enforced by the CA/B forum](https://cabforum.org/2017/03/17/ballot-193-825-day-certificate-lifetimes/)).
- We will allow to purchase 2-year certificates up to August 13, 2020 23:59 UTC
- From August 14, 2020  we will no longer support the purchase or renewal of SSL certificates for a period longer than one year to comply with the new industry standard requirements. You can [read more on our blog](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2020/08/ssl-certificates-1-year/).
