# Changing an SSL Certificate Approver Email

If you selected an invalid approver email, you can request the email to be changed.

The certificate must be in the submitted state.

Please note that [**it's not possible to change the approver email to an arbitrary email address**](/articles/ssl-certificates-email-approval). This is a requirement enforced by the certificate authority for the certificate domain validation.
