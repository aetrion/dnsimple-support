# Adding a Subdomain

A subdomain is, technically speaking, a DNS record for a hostname that belongs to your domain. In other words, to add a subdomain you simply need to use our [DNS record editor](/articles/advanced-editor/) and create the DNS record corresponding to the subdomain.

    That will take you the advanced editor and you may add the records for the subdomain there. 
    
1.  To add a subdomain, just fill in the subdomain in the Name field. For example, "www" would be the subdomain "www.example.com".
