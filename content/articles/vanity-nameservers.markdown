# Vanity Name Servers

If you would like to use our name servers but have them appear as though they were your name servers you may use the vanity name server functionality to accomplish this.

To request access to vanity name servers, please contact support@dnsimple.com.

Please see our documentation about changing to [DNSimple name servers](/articles/dnsimple-nameservers) for the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses required for your vanity name servers.

If you use name servers that are within your domain then activating vanity name servers through DNSimple will automatically add glue records for each of the name servers listed above. If you are using name servers under a different domain then you will need to set up the correct A record for each of the name servers.
