## Retry Failed Payments {#retrying}

While our system occasionally retries failed invoices automatically, it may make sense for you to manually retry your own invoices. The steps are as follows.

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To retry a failed invoice

1. View your [account payment history](#viewing).
1. Locate failed invoices in your payment history. They will be highlighted in red.
1. Click the retry button on your failed invoice.

</div>

<note>
It is possible the retry will not succeed or the invoice will enter a "Needs Review" state. If you have repeated trouble retrying an invoice or have an invoice enter the "Needs Review" state, please [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact) with details about the issue.
