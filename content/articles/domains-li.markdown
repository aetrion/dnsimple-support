## Renewing

### Auto-renewal only {#auto-renewal-required}

This TLD doesn't support manual renewals. In order to successfully renew the domain, the [auto-renewal feature](/articles/domain-auto-renewal) must be enabled at least 1 month before the domain will expire, as explained in the ["auto-renew only" article](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains).

If auto-renewal is not enabled, the domain will be scheduled for removal immediately after the expiration, and the deactivation will take place by the registrar at any point during this period. It may be possible to recover the domain until the final deletion, but the registry will require the payment of a redemption fee.
