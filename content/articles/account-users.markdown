<note>
In order to have multiple members on a single account, you must first [be subscribed to an eligible plan](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) for that account.
</note>

A DNSimple account can be associated to one or more users. When you add a user to an account, the new member will have full access rights on every resource attached to the account, including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

The member will also have full-admin access to the account, including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. The user will retain his login credentials and 2-factor authentication configuration.


## Adding members to an account

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Once you've subscribed to an eligible plan, visit the account page by clicking the name of the account in the menu.

1. Until the user accepts the invitation, it will appear in the pending invitation section. If something is wrong with the invite, you can resend it to the user (they receive another email), or remove it. Removing it will cancel the invitation immediately and the user will no longer be able to accept it.
