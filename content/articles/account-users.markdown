<note>
In order to have multiple members on a single account, you must first [be subscribed to an eligible plan](https://dnsimple.com/pricing) for that account.
</note>

A DNSimple account can be associated to one or more users. When you add an user to an account, the new member will have full access rights on every resource attached to the account, including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

The member will also have full-admin access to the account, including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. However, the user will retain his login credentials and 2-factor authentication configuration.


## Adding members to an account

<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
1. Once you've subscribed to an eligible plan, you should visit the account page by clicking the name of the account in the dropdown menu.
