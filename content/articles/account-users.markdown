A DNSimple account can be associated with one or more users. When you add a user to an account, the new member will have full access rights on every resource attached to the account, including domains, contacts, SSL certificates, etc.

All members will also have full-admin access to the account, including the ability to access and change billing information and account details. The user will retain their login credentials and 2-factor authentication configuration.
