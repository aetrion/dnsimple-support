This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .BE domain names.

## Changing the Contact for a .BE domain {#trade}

Currently we do not support changing the registrant, please contact support@dnsimple.com for further assistance.

## Transferring a .BE domain {#transferring}

Unlike standard gTLD domains, .BE has some unique transfer rules. Please read the information below.

### Authcode {#auth}

As most TLD's .BE requires an authorization code to transfer a domain (but also for changing the contact). That auth code will be sent to the current registrant's e-mail address when you start the transfer process within the domain details page.

You can also request that an authorization code be sent via the [registry website](https://www.dnsbelgium.be/en/manage-domain-name/change-registrar).
