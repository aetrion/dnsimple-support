## What is a Premium Domain?

A premium domain is a domain that is priced differently by a registrar and generally found in the new gTLDs space. They are typically more expensive than a normal domain with prices going into the thousands of dollars in some cases. An example of a gTLD is `.love` or `.ninja`.

## What makes a Premium Domain valuable

Premium domains appeal to specific businesses or groups of people providing them with useful, specific domain names for their activities. Other times they are just popular keywords or a very well known combination of a name and domain. Some registries or registrars also consider two or three letter domains to be more valuable and therefore will be higher priced.

Here is an example: Paris is known as the city of love. The domain created as a combination of these could be `paris.love` and would be a very attractive name for marketing companies or businesses. The `.love` registry therefore may impose a higher fee for this rare and beautiful combination and the registrar may optionally add to this price to make it more expensive than a typical `.love` domain registration.

## What about renewals?

Renewing a premium domain can vary in in cost. It could be the same as a typical renewal or as much as a new registration. The minimum pricing for this is determined by the registry.
