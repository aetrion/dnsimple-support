## What is a Premium Domain?

A premium domain is a domain that has been considered of special value by a registrar. Premium domains generally are available in the new gTLDs domain space. They are usually more expensive that regular domains, prices going up to several thousand dollars for one domain in some cases.

## What makes a Premium Domain valuable

Premium domains appeal to specific businesses or groups of people providing them very with useful, specific domain names for their activities. Other times they are just popular keywords or a very well known combination of name and domain. This is better illustrated with an example: 

For a company such us Heineken, owning the domain heineken.beer is a very powerful and concise way to market its activity, which as you may know is making and selling beers.

## What about renewals?

Renewing a premium domain can cost the same than a registration, but it is up to the registrar to decide that, therefore it depends on every specific gTLD.
