The [WHOIS privacy protection service](/articles/what-is-whois-privacy) keeps your contact information private for a domain. This service replaces the public information that you provide with an anonymous proxy identity in the public WHOIS database.

You can purchase the WHOIS privacy protection for any of your domains at any time, as long as the domain is registered with us and the TLD supports the WHOIS privacy service. You can check if a TLD supports WHOIS privacy from the [list of supported TLDs](https://dnsimple.com/tld-pricing).

<note>
The price for the WHOIS privacy service starts from **$8.00 per year and domain** and it is based on the currently subscribed plan.

## Enable WHOIS privacy

You can enable the WHOIS privacy protection from your domain page or the domain list.

When you enable the service the first time, the service cost will be charged on your account. You can then enable and disable the service at any time, with no additional cost, for one year.
