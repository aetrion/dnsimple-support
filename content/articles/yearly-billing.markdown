# Yearly Billing

When you subscribe to one of our plans you can choose between being billed monthly or yearly. The customers that go for one of our yearly plans benefit from **2 months of service for free**.


## How to switch to yearly billing

Even if you initially subscribe to one of our monthly plans you can switch to one of our yearly plans whenever you want to (and vice versa).

To switch to yearly billing, simply follow the steps described in [the article](/articles/changing-plans) about how to change your subscription plan. Make sure you choose a plan from the appropriate billing period.

When you make the switch, you will automatically be billed for the yearly plan price which already includes the two month discount. The subscription will be automatically renewed once per year, at the date you switched to a yearly plan. You can compare the yearly plans pricing on our [plan page](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).

<note>
Any email forwards or extra zones will be billed immediately for 1 year's worth of service.
