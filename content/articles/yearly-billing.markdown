# Yearly Billing

When you subscribe to one of our plans, you can choose between monthly or yearly billing. Customers who choose one of our yearly plans benefit from **2 months of free service**.

Even if you initially subscribe to one of our monthly plans, you can switch to one of our yearly plans whenever you want to (and vice versa).


<div class="section-steps" markdown="1">
##### To switch to yearly billing:

1.  Log in to DNSimple with your user credentials.
1.  [Find the account](https://dnsimple.com/user) from the account list. Click on the account to enter the account page.
1.  Click the <label>Change</label> link in your plan section.

1.  Confirm the plan.

</div>

When you make the switch, we'll automatically bill you for the yearly plan price, which includes the two month discount. The subscription will be automatically renewed once per year, on the date you switched to the yearly plan. You can compare the yearly plans pricing on our [plan page](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).

<note>
Any email forwards or extra zones will be billed immediately for 1 year's worth of service.
