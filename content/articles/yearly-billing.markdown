# Yearly Billing

By default, all accounts are billed monthly according to the plan you subscribed to. You may, however, switch to yearly billing for your DNSimple subscription and benefit from 1 month of service for free.

## Yearly billing benefits

When you make the switch, you will automatically be billed for a year's worth of service at your current plan type, minus the price of one month. The subscription will be automatically renewed once per year, at the date you switched to yearly billing.

Any email forwards or extra domains (for Platinum accounts) will be billed immediately for 1 year's worth of service.

## Switching to yearly billing

To switch to yearly billing, [log into DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/login) and go to [your account page](https://dnsimple.com/account). There you will see a button to Switch to Yearly Billing.

You can change back to monthly billing at any time and your account will be prorated for the time not yet used.
