# What happens when a domain expires?

When a domain expires, it enters a grace period. Most registries offer a non-guaranteed 29-day grace period for renewal for many TLDs. Each registry has different rules for their grace periods. You can get more information in our [related article](http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/auto-renew-only-domains/).

After a domain has passed through any applicable expiration grace period, the domain may go into a redemption status. A "Redemption Grace Period" or RGP, is the grace period provided after the registrar has issued a delete request to the registry.

Once the Registry deletes the domain, it becomes available for anyone to purchase as a new domain. It is available on a first-come first-serve basis.
