## Invoices without custom billing information

Until we are provided with further information our invoices will only reflect the email address of the DNSimple account the invoice was sent to. All invoices will be sent to your DNSimple account's email address.

### Billing email

The billing email will be displayed on invoices in absence of other billing information. It will also be the email address invoices will be delivered to.

<callout>
If you provide a custom billing email address then it will be used for all invoices. Otherwise your DNSimple account's email address will be used.

<note>
You will only be able to customize your billing address if you are subscribed to one of the following [new plans](/articles/new-plans#newer-plans-some): Professional and Business.
