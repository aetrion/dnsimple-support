# Why we don't offer web hosting services

Traditionally DNS registrars have been offering domains bundled with a hosting solution as part of a basic package. This usually translated into giving a few MegaBytes of disk space exposed by an HTTP server and accessible with a FTP client for the user. The idea behind was that the user could have her personal HTML static site. 

This can cause confusion to people without deep understanding of these technologies. This article explains why DNSimple does not offer web hosting. Some of the reasons are:

 * We do one thing and We do it very well, that is offering the best DNS hosting experience. 
 * Today the web is way more diverse and complex. There is a myriad of technologies available for creating websites. These technologies use several pieces of software to work, database servers, web servers, caching services, load balancers, etc. Websites have heavier hardware requirements than some Megabytes of hard disk. 
 * There is a lot of more useful websites for someone who needs a personal site.
 * The hosting service could only catter to a tiny fraction of our users that still make their HTML static websites.
