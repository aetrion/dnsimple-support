# Why we don't offer web hosting services

Traditionally DNS providers offered a basic web hosting solution along the DNS hosting service. It usually translated into giving several Megabytes of disk space served by an HTTP server and accessible with a FTP client to the user for HTML static sites. 

This can cause confusion to people without deep understanding of these technologies. This article explains why DNSimple does not offer web hosting. Some of the reasons are:

 * Web hosting is not our core business. We do one thing and We do it very well, that is offering the best DNS hosting experience. 
 * Today the web is way more diverse and complex. There is a miriad of technologies available for creating websites. These technologies use several pieces of software to work, database servers, web servers, caching services, load balancers, etc. Websites have heavier hardware requirements than some Megabytes of hard disk. 
 * The hosting service could only catter to a tiny fraction of our users that still make their HTML static websites.
