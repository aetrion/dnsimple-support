This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .CH domain names.


## Changing WHOIS information

To change the WHOIS information on a .CH domain, we will need to submit a TRADE request to the registry. This is a manual process, and it may incur additional charges.

If you want to update the WHOIS information for a .CH domain, please [change or update the contact](/articles/changing-whois-contact/) in your DNSimple account, then contact us with the name of the domain you need to update.

The TRADE fee will be charged to the card associated to the domain account in DNSimple.
