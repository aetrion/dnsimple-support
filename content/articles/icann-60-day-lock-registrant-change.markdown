# 60-Day Lock After Change of Registrant

Due to [ICANN policies that went into effect December 1st, 2016](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/ownership-2013-05-03-en), making changes the registrant contact will lock the domain for 60 days. During that period, it will not be possible to transfer the domain to another registrar.

> After 1 December 2016, registrars must impose a lock that will prevent any transfer to another registrar for sixty (60) days following a change to a registrant's information. Registrars may (but are not required to) allow registrants to opt out of the 60-day lock prior to the change of registrant request.
> 
> To transfer a domain name to another registrar and change the registrant's information, registrants may:
> 
> - Request the transfer to another registrar before changing the registrant's information (to avoid the 60-day lock); or
> - Have the prior registrant opt-out the 60-day lock (if this option is offered by the registrar) before making any change to registrant information.
> 
> Because policies may vary by registrar, please review a registrar's policy before making a change to registrant information or transferring to another registrar.

At the time being, we don't support the ability to opt-out the 60-day lock, therefore we highly recommend that if you plan on transfering your domain you should make sure to wait until it is transferred to update the contact information.
