# Web Hosting Support

At this time, we focus primarily on [domain management services](/articles/dnsimple-services), and we don't provide web hosting.

If you are looking to transfer your domain and your registrar currently provides web hosting then you have a few options:

1. Use a _platform as a service_ provider such as [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) or [Google Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
1. Use a cloud provider such as [Amazon EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) or [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
1. If you want to host a static site, use a cloud hosting solution such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/)

## FTP credentials

Because we don't host your application or files directly, we can't provide any FTP credential. Please refer to your application hosting provider to get information on how to access your content.
