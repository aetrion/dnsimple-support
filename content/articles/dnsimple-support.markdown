## Priority support

If you have a Business subscription, then you are entitled to priority support. Your support emails will go to a support queue dedicated to you and will be answered first before other support requests.

## Tips for getting a faster, more accurate response

- Be sure to include your account email address if you are sending the email from a different email address than your account.
- Include the domain name or names that you are inquiring about.
- Include the full domain name if you are inquiring about a certificate.
- If you are reporting an error, include the steps you took prior to receiving the error message.

## How long before your support request will receive a response?

You should normally receive a response to any support request within 24 hours. You will often receive a response much sooner. Response times may be slower on weekends.
