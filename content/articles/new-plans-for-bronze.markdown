# I'm a Bronze customer, what do the new plans mean for me?

As an existing Bronze customer you will not have access to new features in DNSimple as they are released. If you are an individual, you may want to consider switching to the Personal plan. If you run or manage domains on behalf of a business you may want to consider upgrading to either the Professional or Business plan.

New plans includes several new features, such as:

- [Let's Encrypt integration](/articles/letsencrypt/)
- [CAA records](/articles/manage-caa-record/)
- [DNSSEC](/articles/dnssec/)

New plans also benefit from [reduced whois privacy prices](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2017/10/whois-privacy-price-decrease/).

For the majority of you, the Personal plan will provide greater benefits to you with very little change in your monthly cost. The Personal plan costs $5 per month and includes up to 5 domains. After 5 domains you will only pay $0.50 per domain per month for additional domains. This means that if you are currently a Bronze customers you can add 3 additional domains into your account by switching to the Personal plan, with no change in your monthly fee (or a $2 per month additional cost if you are on the old $3 per month Bronze plan).

Professional and Business plans come with added benefits that help improve domain and DNS management for business customers, such as the new Team feature, which allows you to add team members to an account so they can control and manage all aspects of that account. With the Professional and Business plans, you can also protect yourself with our SLA.

And if you switch to an yearly plan, you'll get 2 months for free!
