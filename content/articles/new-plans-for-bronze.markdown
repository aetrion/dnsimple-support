# I'm a Bronze customer. What do the new plans mean for me?

As an existing Bronze customer, you won't have access to new features in DNSimple as they're released. Individuals should consider switching to the Personal plan. If you run or manage domains on behalf of a business, you should consider upgrading to either the Professional or Business plan.

New plans include several new features, such as:

- [Let's Encrypt integration](/articles/letsencrypt/)
- [CAA records](/articles/manage-caa-record/)
- [DNSSEC](/articles/dnssec/)

New plans also benefit from [reduced whois privacy prices](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2017/10/whois-privacy-price-decrease/).

For the majority of you, the Personal plan will provide greater benefits with minor changes in your monthly cost. The Personal plan costs $5 per month and includes up to 5 domains. After 5 domains, you'll pay $0.50 per domain per month. If you're a Bronze customer, you can add 3 domains to your account by switching to the Personal plan, with no change in your monthly fee (or a $2 per month additional cost if you're on the old $3 per month Bronze plan).

Professional and Business plans come with added benefits tailored to business customers. For example, the Team feature allows you to add team members to an account so they can control and manage all aspects of that account. With the Professional and Business plans, you can protect yourself with our SLA.

If you switch to a yearly plan, we'll give you two months free.
