As an existing Bronze customer, you do not need to make any changes today. You can continue using your current plan until at least the end of June, 2016.

For the majority of you, the Personal plan will provide greater benefits to you with very little change in your monthly cost. The Personal plan costs $5 per month and includes up to 5 domains. After 5 domains you will only pay $0.50 per domain per month for additional domains. This means that if you are currently a Bronze customers you can add 3 additional domains into your account by switching to the Personal plan, with little to no additional change in your monthly fee.
