When your domain list grows and becomes hard to maintain, labels can help you organize your inventory.

## Adding labels

From the domain list page, select the domains that you want to label and then click "Label domains" at the bottom of the list.

A popup appears where you can type a label. To add multiple labels at once, separate them with a comma.

The domain list now displays the labels.

## Filtering by labels

To filter your domain list based on labels, select any label from the filter dropdown in the top navigation filters. The table will then only show the domains based on that label. The number next to the label indicates the number of domains organized by the label.

## Editing and removing labels

Editing labels is as simple as choosing the domain or domains that you want to correct the labels for. See [how to add labels](#adding-labels). On the label popup, you can edit the label name.

To remove labels, just clear out the label input leaving it blank.
