# Organizing and labeling domains

* TOC

When your domain list grows and becomes hard to maintain, labels can help you organize your inventory.

## Adding labels

From the domain list page, select the domains that you want to label and then select "Apply labels" from the dropdown at the bottom of the list.

A popup will appear where you can type your labels separated by a comma.

The domain list now displays the labels.

## Filtering by labels

To filter your domain list based on labels, select any label from the filter dropdown at the top of the domain list table. The table will then only show the domains based on that label.

## Editing and removing labels

Editing labels is as simple as choosing the domain or domains that you want to correct the labels for. See [how to add labels](#adding-labels). From the dropdown at the bottom of the domain list, select the "Apply labels" option from the dropdown. A popup will appear where you can correct the labels.

Removing labels is the same process as editing labels but leaving the labels blank.
