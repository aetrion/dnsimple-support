# Importing a Domain Zone File

You can import the DNS records for your domain into DNSimple with our Zone import feature. Use this to quickly import all your DNS records from a domain that you want to transfer to us to avoid downtime during the transfer.

Most DNS providers give you the option to export your zone data. We currently accept zones in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file](BIND format)

To import the zone, browse to your domain's settings. Click "Import from a zone file".

Then enter your zone data in the BIND file format and import the data.
