# Changing Account Email

When you initially create a user in our system, we create an account bound to that user. We call this the Primary Account. and its email address is the same as the user. If you change the email address of that user, the account email address is also updated. This allows customers with a single account to only have to update their email in a single place. Follow the instructions in [Changing User Email](/articles/changing-user-email/) if this is the case for you.

Extra Accounts created have their own email address that can be changed ad-hoc. Follow the following steps to change the email address:
