# Changing Account Email

When you initially create a user in our system we create an account that is bound to that user, internally we call this the Primary Account. Its email address is the same as the user. If you change the email address of that user, the account email address is also updated. This allows customers with a single account, like most do, to only have to update their email in a single place. Please follow the instructions at the [Changing User Email](/articles/changing-user-email/) document if this is the case for you.

Extra Accounts created have their own email address that can be changed ad-hoc. Please follow the following steps to change the email address.
