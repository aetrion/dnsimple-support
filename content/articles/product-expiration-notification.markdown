# "Product Expiration" Notification

The **Product Expiration** email contains the list of products (purchased domains, certificates and whois privacies) expiring within 2 months, grouped by expiration range.

There are four expiration ranges: in a day, within a week, a month and 2 months. These ranges cannot be customized.

The expiring product notification system is designed to reduce the number of emails we deliver to your inbox and make them more effective.

The notification is delivered as soon as one of your products enters the 60-day expiration period. We deliver at most one email every week, containing an overview of all your expiring products.

This email is part of the [expiring product notification feature](/articles/expiring-product-email-notifications).
