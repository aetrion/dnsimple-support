# How do I add a subdomain?

Go to the domain's management page

![Domain Manage Page](http://cl.ly/image/3S0c302I2f2P/example-domain.com%20-%20manage.jpg)

then click on the DNS tab and click "Add or edit custom records" under the list of current records.

That will take you the advanced editor and you may add the records for the subdomain there. To add a subdomain, just fill in the subdomain in the Name field. For example, "www" would be the subdomain "www.example.com".
