# Purchasing an SSL Certificate without DNSimple DNS service

If you only want to purchase an SSL certificate from us, and your DNS and/or domain registrations are with another provider, you are free to do so.

First, follow the [getting started guide](http://support.dnsimple.com/articles/getting-started-ssl-certificates) for purchasing and installing your certificate.

Once your certificate is issued and installed, go to your Account page and unsubscribe. You must only do this *after* your certificate is fully issued.

Your user account will remain available and you will still receive notifications when your certificate nears expiration. You will need to re-activate your account in the future if you would like to purchase additional certificates with us.

<warning>
### Don't close your account

You should not close your user account, rather you should only unsubscribe, otherwise you will not be able to access your certificate details and private key in the future.
</warning>
