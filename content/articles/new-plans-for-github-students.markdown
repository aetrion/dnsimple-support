As an existing GitHub Student Pack customer, you will automatically be converted to the Personal plan. Instead of 2 domains you will now have the ability to manage 5 domains in your GitHub Student Pack account.

If you add more than 5 domains then your per-month debit from your balance will increase by $0.50 per domain per month. If you upgrade to the Professional or Business plan, then your balance will decrease by that plan's monthly price, along with its additional domain price if you have more than 5 domains.
