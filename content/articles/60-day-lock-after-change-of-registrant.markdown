# 60-Day Lock After Change of Registrant

Due to [ICANN policies that went into effect December 1st, 2016][ICANN] you can no longer transfer a domain after changing the registrant information. The exact wording of the rule is as follows;

```
After 1 December 2016, registrars must impose a lock that will prevent any transfer to
  another registrar for sixty (60) days following a change to a registrant's
  information. Registrars may (but are not required to) allow registrants to opt out
  of the 60-day lock prior to the change of registrant request.

To transfer a domain name to another registrar and change the registrant's
  information, registrants may:

Request the transfer to another registrar before changing the registrant's information
 (to avoid the 60-day lock); or

Have the prior registrant opt-out the 60-day lock (if this option is offered by the
  registrar) before making any change to registrant information.
Because policies may vary by registrar, please review a registrar's policy before
  making a change to registrant information or transferring to another registrar.
```

As we do not have the ability to opt-out currently we highly recommend that if you plan on transfering your domain you should make sure to wait until it is transferred to update the contact information.
