# Cancel your subscription

Cancelling your subscription will unsubscribe your account from the recurring subscription plan, without deleting the plan.

After unsubscribing you will no longer be charged a monthly/yearly fee and your domains will no longer resolve with us. You may resubscribe at any time and your domains will resolve again.

<info>
All your domains and records will remain in your account. You will also be able to transfer your domains out of DNSimple.
