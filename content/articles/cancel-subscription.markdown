# Cancel your subscription

After unsubscribing you will no longer be charged a monthly/yearly fee and your domains will no longer resolve with us. You may resubscribe at any time and your domains will resolve again.

All your domains and records will remain in your account. You will also be able to transfer your domains out of DNSimple.
