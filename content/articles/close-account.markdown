# Deleting Your User

Deleting your user will permanently delete your DNSimple user and permanently delete all your domains in all your accounts, records and all associated information.

<warning>
Once your user is deleted all your domains and records will be deleted. You will no longer be able to request transfer codes and unlock registered domains in order to transfer them to another registrar.
</warning>

<note>
To delete your user, you will first need to [unsubscribe your accounts from your plan at DNSimple](/articles/cancel-subscription).
</note>

##### To permanently delete your user, along with all your domains and records:

1. Go to [your User Settings page](https://dnsimple.com/user):

1. Click on the <label>Delete user</label> button at the bottom of the page:

## Deleting an account

At the time being, it's not possible for a customer to independently delete an account created using the multi-account feature. If you wish to delete one of your accounts, please [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact) so we can sort it out for you..
