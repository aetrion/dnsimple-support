# Close Your Account

To close your account and remove all of your domains from DNSimple, log in and go to https://dnsimple.com/account and click on the red "Close Account" button at the bottom of the page.

This will immediately stop all domain resolution for your domains through DNSimple. Additionally you will no longer be able to request transfer codes and unlock registered domains in order to transfer them to another registrar.
