# Closing Your User Account

Closing your account permanently deletes your DNSimple user account, all your domains, records and associated information.

<warning>
Once your account is closed, all your domains and records will be deleted. You will no longer be able to request transfer codes or unlock registered domains to transfer them to another registrar.
</warning>

<note>
To close your user account, you'll first need to [unsubscribe from your plan at DNSimple](/articles/cancel-subscription).
</note>

##### To permanently delete your user account, along with all your domains and records:

1. Go to [your user page](https://dnsimple.com/user):

1. Click on the red <label>Close account</label> button at the bottom of the page:
