The Domain Name System (DNS) is composed by more than 30 different record types (technically called resource records): [A](/articles/a-record), [AAAA](/articles/aaaa-record), [CNAME](/articles/cname-record), [MX](/articles/mx-record), [CAA](/articles/caa-record), etc. Some record types are very common, others less relevant, and others deprecated or replaced.

[DNSimple supports the most common and traditional record types](/articles/supported-dns-records), as well some newer types introduced to provide innovative services. In this article we'll look at the most common record types, as well the most common DNS records you are likely need for your domain to work properly.
