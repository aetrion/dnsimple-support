# Exporting a Domain Zone File

With the Zone export feature you can export all the DNS records for a domain in a zone file to use with a third-party system.

For example, if you want to bulk migrate a domain zone to a secondary name server or create a backup of your domain records, you can export the domain zone and import it into a third-party system.

The exported data follows the BIND zone file format.
