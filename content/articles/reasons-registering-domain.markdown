# Why Should I Register my Domain Name with DNSimple?

Domain registration with DNSimple is designed to be quick and easy with no up-selling or hassles.

Domain registration is a simple process:

- Enter a name and verify that it is available.
- Select a registrant from your contacts or add a new contact.
- For domains that require extended attributes (like .ca and .us), fill in the required fields.
- Register the domain.

Yes, it's really that easy. We won't try to sell you a bunch of other services when you register your domain.

All domains registered with DNSimple automatically use DNSimple's name servers and hosted DNS, making the domain set up process very straightforward.

**Note:** We do not currently offer domain registration as a stand-alone service. Our core business is hosted DNS and thus the registration requires the use of our hosted DNS service. We do provide hosted DNS without using our registration services.
