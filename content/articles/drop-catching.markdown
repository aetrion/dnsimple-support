# Can I use DNSimple for drop catching?

No, you may not use DNSimple to drop catch domains.

## What is drop catching?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_drop_catching):

> Domain drop catching, also known as domain sniping, is the practice of registering a domain name once registration has lapsed, immediately after expiration.

## Why don't you allow drop catching?

Our upstream domain registration provider limits the number of checks we're allowed to execute. Attempts to engage in drop catching impact all our customers. 

## What happens if I try to drop catch?

If we observe drop catching we will disable your account to avoid impacting all DNSimple customers.
