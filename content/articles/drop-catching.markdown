# Can I use DNSimple for drop catching?

No, you may not use DNSimple for drop catching domains at this time.

## What is drop catching?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_drop_catching):

> Domain drop catching, also known as domain sniping, is the practice of registering a domain name once registration has lapsed, immediately after expiration.

## Why do you not allow drop catching?

Our upstream domain registration provider limits the number of checks we are allowed to execute. If you attempt to engage in drop catching then this will impact all of our customers. 

## What happens if I try to drop catch?

If we observe drop catching we will be forced to disable your account to avoid impacting all DNSimple customers.
