## What is drop catching?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_drop_catching):

> Domain drop catching, also known as domain sniping, is the practice of registering a domain name once registration has lapsed, immediately after expiration.

## Can I use DNSimple for drop catching?

No, you may not use DNSimple for drop catching domains.

## Why don't you allow drop catching?

Our upstream domain registration provider limits the number of checks we are allowed to execute. If you attempt to engage in drop catching, this will impact all of our customers. 

## What happens if I try to drop catch?

If we observe drop catching, we will disable your account to avoid impacting all DNSimple customers.
