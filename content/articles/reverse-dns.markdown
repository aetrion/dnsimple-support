# Reverse DNS Zones

<info>
This article describes a feature only available on the following plans: Professional and Business.

This feature is not available on our Legacy Plans. Click [here](/articles/changing-plans/) to change your plan, and unlock this feature.
</info>

DNSimple supports reverse DNS entries (i.e. PTR records). This feature can be enabled on our Professional and Business plans. Please ensure you can delegate the portion of the subnet you want us to respond to for reverse DNS queries. Once you've confirmed this, [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact), and we'll enable the feature for you.

Depending on your DNS host, you may not have control over your subnet. In this case, you'll need to ask your hosting company to set up the reverse DNS entries you require.
