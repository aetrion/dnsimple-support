# Do you support Reverse DNS (i.e. PTR records)?

DNSimple does support reverse DNS entries however we do not enable this feature by default on customer accounts. We'll be happy to enable it for you, however first please ensure that you will actually be able to delegate the portion of the subnet that you would like us to respond for reverse DNS queries.

In many cases you may not have control over your subnet, depending on your hosting company for that service. In this case you should ask your hosting company to set up the reverse DNS entries you require.
