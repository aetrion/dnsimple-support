# Reverse DNS zones

<note>
This article describes a feature that is only available to the following [new plans](/articles/new-plans#newer-plans-some): Professional and Business.
</note>

DNSimple does support reverse DNS entries (i.e. PTR records), the feature can be enabled for our Professional and Business subscribers. Please ensure that you will actually be able to delegate the portion of the subnet that you would like us to respond for reverse DNS queries. Once this is confirmed, [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact) and we will enable the feature for you.

In many cases you may not have control over your subnet, depending on your hosting company for that service. In this case you should ask your hosting company to set up the reverse DNS entries you require.
