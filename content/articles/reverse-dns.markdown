# Reverse DNS Zones

<info>
This article describes a feature only available on the following plans: Professional and Business.

This feature is not available on our Legacy Plans. Click [here](/articles/changing-plans/) to change your plan and unlock this feature.
</info>

DNSimple supports reverse DNS entries (i.e. PTR records). This feature can be enabled for our Professional and Business subscribers. Please ensure you can delegate the portion of the subnet you want us to respond to for reverse DNS queries. Once this is confirmed, [contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact), and we'll enable the feature for you.

Depending on your hosting company for the service, you may not have control over your subnet. In this case, you should ask your hosting company to set up the reverse DNS entries you require.
