# Sharing Domain Management with Another User

In DNSimple you can share a domain with other users so that they can manage it. For example, if you have a large organization you can share access to the domains with one or more users.

Please see http://blog.dnsimple.com/sharing-domain-management-responsibilities/ for a walk through of how sharing works.

Currently you can only share DNS management responsibilities with others but you cannot give them privileges to add or modify domain registrations, transfers or SSL certificates.
