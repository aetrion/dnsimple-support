Depending on the billing cycle of the plan for which you signed up, your subscription will be renewed either monthly or yearly. The payment for the renewal will be charged to the card on file or, in case you have an a subscription credit, deducted from from the credit balance.

The amount to be charged depends on:

- The price of the plan you are subscribed to;
- The number of extra domains you have in your account; and
- The number of domains that have email forwards configured.

<note>
If you want to know the exact amount you will be charged in your next renewal, and when your subscription is due to renew, you can find this information on [the account page](/articles/new-account-page/#plan-breakdown).

## What happens when my subscription is renewed

When the renewal of your subscription is successfully processed, we will send you an invoice, and the service will be extended for the duration of your plan's billing cycle: either 1 month or 1 year.


## What happens when the payment for the renewal fails

If your subscription renewal payment fails, you will receive a dunned invoice and an email that will include details about the failure.

If this happens please don't panic: your account will not be canceled, and your domains will continue to resolve. We are well aware that credit cards expire and wallets are lost; that's why we give our customers plenty of time to resolve their payment issues. Since the first failed payment attempt **you have 20 days to finalize the payment**.

**Our system will try to renew the subscription and collect the payment daily** during that period. You will be notified about the outcome of these attempts.

<note>
You won't be able to manually retry the payments for subscription renewal fees. You will have to wait for our system to automatically do that for you.

If you know that you won't be able to provide a valid card number before your subscription gets canceled, [please contact us](https://dnsimple.com/contact).

## What happens if my subscription is canceled

When your subscription is canceled because of too many failed renewal attempts, you will be immediately notified by email, and the services DNSimple provides will stop. [This support article](/articles/what-happens-if-i-stop-paying) explains what you can expect in this situation.

Keep in mind even if your subscription is canceled, you will always be able to [reactivate it](/articles/reactivate-subscription).
