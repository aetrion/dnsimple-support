Depending on the billing cycle of the plan you signed up for your subscription will be renewed either monthly or yearly. The payment for the renewal will be charged to the credit card on file. The amount will depend on 3 things:
- The price of the plan you are subscribed to.
- The number of extra domains you have in your account.
- The number of domains that have email forwards configured.

<note>
If you want to know the exact amount you will be charged in your next renewal and when your subscription is due to renew, you can find this information in [the account page](/articles/new-account-page/#plan-breakdown).

## What happens when my subscription is renewed

When the renewal of your subscription is successfully processed we will send you an invoice. The service will be extended for the duration of your plan's billing cycle: either 1 month or 1 year.


## What happens when the payment for the renewal fails

When your subscription renewal payment fails you will receive a dunned invoice and an email that will include details about the failure.

If this happens please don't panic: your account will not be canceled and your domains will continue to resolve. We are well aware that credit cards expire and wallets are lost. That's why we give our customers plenty of time (more than 2 weeks) to resolve their payment issues.

**Our system will try to renew the subscription and collect the payment daily** during that period. You will be notified about the outcome of these attempts.

<note>
You won't be able to manually retry the payments for subscription renewal fees. You will have to wait for our system to automatically do that for you.

If you know that you won't be able to provide a valid credit card number before your subscription gets canceled, please contact us on [support@dnsimple.com](mailto:support@dnsimple.com).

## What happens if my subscription is canceled

When your subscription is canceled because of too many failed renewal attempts you will be immediately notified by email and the service DNSimple provides will stop. [This support article](/articles/what-happens-if-i-stop-paying) explains what you can expect in this situation.

Keep in mind that even if your subscription is canceled you will allways be able to [reactivate it](/articles/reactivate-subscription).
