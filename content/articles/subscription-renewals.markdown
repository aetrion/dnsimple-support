Depending on the billing cycle of the plan you are subscribed to your subscription will be renewed monthly or yearly. The payment for the renewal will be charged to the credit card on file. The amount will depend on 3 factors:
- The plan you are subscribed to.
- The number of extra domains you have in your account.
- The number of domains in which you have configured email forwards.

<note>
If you want to know the exact amount you will be charged in your next renewal and when your subscription is due to renew, you can find this information in [the account page](/articles/new-account-page/#plan-breakdown).
</note>

When the renewal of your subscription is successfully processed we will send you an invoice.


## What happens when the payment for the renewal fails

When the payment for your subscription renewal fails you will receive a dunned invoice and a notification that will include details about why the payment failed:

If this happens please don't panic: your account will not be canceled and your domains will continue to resolve. We are well aware that credit cards expire and wallets are lost. That's why we give our customer plenty of time (more than 2 weeks) to resolve their payment issues.

**Our system will try to renew the subscription and collect the payment daily**. For as long as it fails you will continue to be notified.

<note>
You won't be able to manually retry the payments for subscription renewal fees. You will have to wait for our system to automatically do that for you.

If you know that you won't be able to provide a valid credit card number before your subscription gets canceled, please contact us on support@dnsimple.com.

## What happens if my subscription is canceled

When your account is canceled because of too many failed renewal attempts you will receive a notification:

If your subscription is canceled your domains will be affected. [This support article](/articles/what-happens-if-i-stop-paying) explains what you can expect in this situation.

Also keep in mind that even if your subscription is canceled, you can always [reactivate it](/articles/reactivate-subscription).
