# Testing Forwarding

Once email forwarding is configured for your domain you may wish to confirm it is working as expected by sending a test message.

If you are using a GMail account in this case you may be surprised. Google silently ignores messages it determines were sent and received from the same account. This will occur even if the message is forwarded through another address.

To properly test that email forwarding please use an entirely separate account from the one that will receive forwarded messages.
