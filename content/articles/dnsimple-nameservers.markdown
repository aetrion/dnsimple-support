# DNSimple Name Servers

In order for DNSimple to provide DNS for one of your domain names you must change the name servers for your domain at your domain registrar.

The DNSimple name servers are:

- ns1.dnsimple.com
- ns2.dnsimple.com
- ns3.dnsimple.com
- ns4.dnsimple.com

If you registered your domain with DNSimple then your name servers will already be set to the DNSimple name servers and there is nothing else you need to do.

If you transferred your domain into DNSimple from another registrar then you need to change your name severs to DNSimple once you are ready for us to provide your DNS. To change your name servers to DNSimple for a domain that you transferred just go to your domain page and follow the link that *Switch to DNSimple Name Servers*. We do not automatically change your name servers to ours during the transfer process.

If you need to provide the IP addresses to your current registrar you may use the following addresses:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>IPv4 Address</th>
<th>IPv6 Address</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ns1.dnsimple.com</td>
<td>198.241.10.53</td>
<td>2620:111:8000::53</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ns2.dnsimple.com</td>
<td>198.241.11.53</td>
<td>2620:111:8001::53</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ns3.dnsimple.com</td>
<td>50.31.242.53</td>
<td>2620:111:8002::53</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ns4.dnsimple.com</td>
<td>50.31.243.53</td>
<td>2620:111:8003::53</td>
</tr>
</table>
