# DNSimple Services

DNSimple provides several services that every system connected to the Internet needs: domain registration, hosted DNS and SSL certificates.

## DNS Hosting

DNSimple DNS hosting is billed as a monthly service. We currently offer three pricing tiers:

- **Bronze** $3/month for up to 2 managed domains 
- **Silver** $8/month for up to 10 managed domains
- **Gold**: $18/month for up to 50 managed domains
- **Platinum**: $50/month for up to 500 managed domains

## Domain Registration

DNSimple domain registrations and transfers are billed on a yearly basis. Pricing varies depending on the domain name. For more information view the [domain pricing list](https://dnsimple.com/tld-pricing).

As a DNSimple customer you do not need to use our domain registration services in order to take advantage of our hosted DNS. If you want to use another registrar you may do so and just change your name servers to our name servers for domains that you want us to provide hosted DNS for.

## SSL Certificates

SSL certificates are available in two flavors:

- Standard single host SSL certificates from RapidSSL ($20 per year)
- Wildcard certificates from Comodo ($100 per year)
