# DNSimple Services

DNSimple provides several services that every system connected to the Internet needs: domain registration, hosted DNS, a powerful automation API, One-Click DNS services, and SSL certificates.

## DNS Hosting

DNSimple DNS hosting is billed as a monthly service. Pricing is available on our [pricing page](https://dnsimple.com/pricing). If you sign up or upgrade to a yearly plan then you may also receive a discount on your total subscription price.

## Domain Registration

DNSimple domain registrations and transfers are billed on a yearly basis. Pricing varies depending on the domain name. For more information view the [domain pricing list](https://dnsimple.com/tlds).

As a DNSimple customer you do not need to use our domain registration services in order to take advantage of our hosted DNS. If you want to use another registrar you may do so and just change your name servers to our name servers for domains that you want us to provide hosted DNS for.

## Powerful Automation API

With the DNSimple REST API you can register domain names and administrate them directly from your own scripts. We have a [repository filled with API examples](https://github.com/dnsimple/dnsimple-api-examples) so you can get up and running right away. Some of the things you can do with our API include:

- Check domain availability
- Register and renew domains
- Transfer domains
- Buy SSL certificates
- List and Manage Records
- Register to events using [webhooks](https://dnsimple.com/webhooks) to receive notification of changes
