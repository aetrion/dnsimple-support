# DNSimple Services

DNSimple provides essential services for every Internet-connected system: domain registration, hosted DNS, a powerful automation API, One-Click DNS services, and SSL certificates.

## DNS Hosting

We bill DNS hosting as a monthly service. If you sign up for or upgrade to a yearly plan, you may receive a discount on your total subscription price. Pricing is available on our [pricing page](https://dnsimple.com/pricing).

## Domain Registration

We bill domain registrations and transfers on a yearly basis. Pricing varies depending on the domain name. For more information, view the [domain pricing list](https://dnsimple.com/tlds).

Want to use our DNS hosting, but not registration? You're welcome to use another registrar and simply change your name servers to our name servers. DNSimple customers don't need to use our domain registration services to take advantage of our hosted DNS.

## Powerful Automation API

With the DNSimple REST API you can register domain names and administrate them directly from your own scripts. We have a [repository filled with API examples](https://github.com/dnsimple/dnsimple-api-examples) so you can get up and running right away. Some things you can do with our API include:

- Check domain availability
- Register and renew domains
- Transfer domains
- Buy SSL certificates
- List and Manage Records
- Register to events using [webhooks](https://dnsimple.com/webhooks) to receive notification of changes
