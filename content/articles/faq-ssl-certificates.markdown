1.  #### I want to purchase an SSL certificate. What is the DNSimple subscription?

    DNSimple is a subscription-based service. You need an active subscription in our to use our platform and domain services.

    The subscription gives you access to both the included platform services (such as the API access and the DNS hosting), and the paid products (such as the domain registration, SSL certificates, email forwarding, etc.).

1.  #### I want to purchase an SSL certificate. Do I need a subscription?

    Yes. As explained in the previous question, SSL certificates are one of our paid products, provided as part of our subscription service.

    In order to purchase an SSL certificate you need an active subscription at the time of the purchase. You are not required to have an active subscription to use or install the certificate on your domain/server, however please note that if you disable the subscription you will not receive any additional service for the domain or the certificate.

    You will also need a valid, active subscription when you renew the certificate, or if you want to reissue the certificate.

## Types of Certificates

<div class="section-faq" markdown="1">
1.  #### What type of SSL certificates does DNSimple provide?

    We currently offer different types of _domain-validated_ SSL certificates, signed by globally recognized certificate authorities. We don't provide _organization-validated_ (OV) or _extended-validation_ (EV).

    To learn more visit the [SSL Certificates](/articles/ssl-certificates/) article.

1.  #### What certificates show the company name in the green bar near the padlock?

    The green bar in the browser is displayed only if you purchase an _extended-validation_ (EV) certificate. We currently do not sell EV certificates.

    We currently only sell DV certificates. These are less expensive than EV certificates and offer the same cryptographic level of security. If you still need/want to purchase an EV certificate we provide some recommendation at [this page](/articles/can-ev-ssl-certificates/).
