# I'm a Gold customer, what do the new plans mean for me?

As an existing Gold customer, you do not need to make any changes today. You can continue using your current plan until at least the end of June, 2016.

If you are managing a personal portfolio of domains then you may be able to save money on your monthly DNS subscription charges by switching to the new Personal plan. The Personal plan is $5 per month for up to 5 domains and then $0.50 per domain per month thereafter. Thus, if you have 11 domains, you could save $8 off your monthly bill by switching to the Personal plan. If you have 20 domains, you could save $0.50 each month.

If you run, or manage domains on behalf of, a business, you may want to consider upgrading to either the Professional or Business plan. These plans come with added benefits that help improve domain and DNS management for business customers, such as the new Team feature, which allows you to add team members to an account so they can control and manage all aspects of that account. With the Professional and Business plans, you can also protect yourself with our SLA. Professional plans come with 99% SLA and Business plans come with a 100% SLA. Business plans also include our concierge service, letting you hand off the transfer of domains into your account for no additional charge to you. Your concierge can also help answer questions about your domains and DNS and assist you in finding the best set up for your business domains.
