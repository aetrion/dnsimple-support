# I'm a Gold customer, what do the new plans mean for me?

As an existing Gold customer you will not have access to new features in DNSimple as they are released. If you are an individual, you may want to consider switching to the Personal plan. If you run or manage domains on behalf of a business you may want to consider upgrading to either the Professional or Business plan.

New plans includes several new features, such as:

- [Let's Encrypt integration](/articles/letsencrypt/)
- [CAA records](/articles/manage-caa-record/)
- [DNSSEC](/articles/dnssec/)

New plans also benefit from [reduced whois privacy prices](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2017/10/whois-privacy-price-decrease/).

If you are managing a personal portfolio of domains then you may be able to save money on your monthly DNS subscription charges by switching to the new Personal plan. The Personal plan is $5 per month for up to 5 domains and then $0.50 per domain per month thereafter. Thus, if you have 11 domains, you could save $8 off your monthly bill by switching to the Personal plan. If you have 20 domains, you could save $0.50 each month.

Professional and Business plans come with added benefits that help improve domain and DNS management for business customers, such as the new Team feature, which allows you to add team members to an account so they can control and manage all aspects of that account. With the Professional and Business plans, you can also protect yourself with our SLA.

And if you switch to an yearly plan, you'll get 2 months for free!
