# "Auto-renew" only domains

Certain domain names are **auto-renew only** and cannot be renewed manually. For these domains it's important to have the [auto-renewal feature turned on](/articles/domain-auto-renewal/) at least 1 month prior to the expiration date.

<warning>
Auto-renewals are automatically processed by the registrar at any time within the last 30 days before expiration. Enabling the auto-renew feature a few days or immediately before the expiration date is not enough to ensure the domain will be automatically renewed and **you risk losing your domain**. In most cases the registrar will also require you to pay an extra fee to recover the domain from deletion.
</warning>

The best solution is to always have auto-renewal enabled. We notify you 2 months before a domain is auto-renewed, therefore you also have the chance to disable auto-renewal should you not want to keep the domain.

The following TLDs are auto-renewal only:

- `.AC`
- `.AT`
- `.AU`
- `.BE`
- `.CH`
- `.DE`
- `.ES`
- `.FR`
- `.IO`
