# "Auto-Renew" Only Domains

Certain domain names are **auto-renew only** and cannot be renewed manually. For these domains, it's important to have the [auto-renewal feature turned on](/articles/domain-auto-renewal) at least 1 month prior to the expiration date.

<warning>
Auto-renewals are automatically processed by the registrar at any time within the last 30 days before expiration. Enabling the auto-renew feature a few days or immediately before the expiration date is not enough to ensure the domain will be automatically renewed and **you risk losing your domain**. In most cases, the registrar will also require you to pay an extra fee to recover the domain from deletion.
</warning>

The best solution is to always have auto-renewal enabled. We notify you 2 months before a domain is auto-renewed, so you have the opportunity to disable auto-renewal if you don't want to keep the domain.

For further information, visit the [TLD-specific articles](/categories/domains/). If a domain requires auto-renewal, we will indicate it with a message in the renewal section of the domain, in your DNSimple account page.
