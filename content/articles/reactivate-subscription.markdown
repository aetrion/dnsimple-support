# Reactivate your subscription

When you [unsubscribe](/articles/cancel-subscription) all your domains and records remain in your account. You can reactivate your subscription and start using DNSimple's services again at any point in time.

<note>
If you were subscribed to a [Legacy Plan](/articles/new-plans#legacy-plans) you will have to choose one of our [new feature-based plans](/articles/new-plans/#newer-plans) during the reactivation process.
</note>

<note>
If you subscribed to DNSimple in the past you already enjoyed our 1 month trial. **Reactivating your subscription will not grant you another 30 day trial**.
