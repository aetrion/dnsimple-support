# Enable or Disable Auto-Renewal on a Domain

By default, newly registered domains are set to auto-renew, but if you have turned off auto-renewal and would like to re-enable auto-renewal for your domain, you should follow these steps.

<warning>
Keep in mind that [some registries require that domains renew through auto-renewal](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains/). If you disable auto-renewal for a domain that requires auto-renewal to renew, then you risk losing the domain.
