# Do you support Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) SSL certificates?

You currently **cannot purchase certificates with elliptic curve keys**. If you submit a custom CSR signed with an ECC key it will be rejected by our certificate authority with an error message indicating the key is too short.

We are aware of the advantages of ECC certificates and we hope to support them in the future.
