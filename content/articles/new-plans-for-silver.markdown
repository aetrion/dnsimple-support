# I'm a Silver customer. What do the newer plans mean for me?

As an existing Silver customer you won't have access to new features in DNSimple as they're released. If you run or manage domains on behalf of a business, you should consider upgrading to either the Professional or Business plan. Individuals should consider switching to the Personal plan.

Newer plans include several features, such as:

- [Let's Encrypt integration](/articles/letsencrypt/)
- [CAA records](/articles/manage-caa-record/)
- [DNSSEC](/articles/dnssec/)

Newer plans also benefit from [reduced whois privacy prices](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2017/10/whois-privacy-price-decrease/).

The Personal plan is $6 per month for up to 5 domains and $0.50 per domain per month thereafter. If you're a Silver customer with 4 domains, switching to the Personal plan will save you $2 each month.

Professional and Business plans come with added benefits tailored to business customers. For example, the Team feature allows you to add team members to an account so they can control and manage all aspects of that account. You can also protect yourself with our SLA on the Professional and Business plans. 

As an added bonus, if you switch to a yearly plan, we'll give you two months free.
