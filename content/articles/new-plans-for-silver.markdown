As an existing Silver customer, you do not need to make any changes today. You can continue using your current plan until at least the end of June, 2016.

You may want to consider switching to the Personal plan as it will save money each month. The Personal plan costs $5 per month and includes up to 5 domains. After 5 domains you will only pay $0.50 per domain per month for additional domains. This means that if you are currently a Silver customer with 4 domains, then switching to the Personal plan will save you $2.50 each month. If you are a Silver customer with 10 domains, then you will save $0.50 per month.
