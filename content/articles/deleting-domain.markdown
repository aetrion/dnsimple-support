# Deleting a Domain

To delete a domain from your DNSimple account go to the [domain list](https://dnsimple.com/domains), search for the domain then press the *Delete Domain* button.

When a domain is deleted, DNSimple will stop resolving DNS for the domain.

If the domain is resolved with DNSimple, we will immediately stop resolving it and the records will be removed according to their TTL.

If the domain is registered with DNSimple, deleting the domain from your account will not delete the domain registration in the registry. Once a domain is registered you can't delete it, you have to wait for the domain to expire.

You should not delete a active domain registered or resolved with DNSimple.
