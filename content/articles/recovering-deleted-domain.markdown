# Recovering a Deleted Domain

<warning>
When recovering a domain, we won't be able to add back your DNS records. We recommend you keep a [copy of your zone file](/articles/zone-files/#exporting-records-to-a-zone-file) before deleting any domain from DNSimple.
</warning>

## The domain was registered with DNSimple
When you [delete a domain](/articles/deleting-domain) that you registered through DNSimple from your account, the domain is still present in the registry (you can verify this by running [a WHOIS lookup](https://dnsimple.com/whois)). The domain will remain registered and belong to you until the registry deletes it, once expired.
