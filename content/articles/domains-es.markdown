This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .ES domain names.

## Renewing a .ES domain

ES domains do not follow the same renewal procedures as TLDs like .com, .net, and .org. ES domains must have auto-renewal enabled at least 30 days prior to expiration. This is because ES domains do not have a typical redemption period as other popular TLDs mentioned before, they begin the deletion process a few days before expiration.

If your domain is in this redemption period, it will need to be manually renewed by support for a substantial fee imposed by the registry. As soon as the expiration date happens and it is not renewed, the domain is immediately deleted and made available for registration again.

## Requirements

Anyone may register a .ES domain, however you will need to provide additional information:

1. Registrant ID Type: You may choose to provide us any of the following identification details:
  - VAT ID (DNI or NIF): Select this option if you can provide us either your Spanish National Personal ID or your company VAT ID number;
  - Resident alien ID (NIE): Select this option if you can provide us your Spanish resident alien ID number;
  - Generic ID: Select this option if you do not have any of the above mentioned IDs, but can provide either your Passport number, any Foreign ID document number, Company Registration number, Driverâ€™s License number, etc.
1. Registrant ID Number: Depending upon the option you selected above, you need to provide that ID's number here.
