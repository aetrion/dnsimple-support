# What is a TLD?

The term top-level domain, or TLD, refers to the first part of every domain name. For example, in the domain name dnsimple.com the TLD is com.

DNSimple supports almost every TLD for hosted DNS and supports a large number of TLDs for registration. For more details view the [full list of TLDs supported by DNSimple for registration and transfer](https://dnsimple.com/tld-pricing).
