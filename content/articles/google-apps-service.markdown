## Setting up At Google

Make sure to verify your domain name once you have enabled the service. You can find out more about domain name verification with Google through their [support site](https://support.google.com/a/search?q=domain+verification).


## Verifying MX Records

Google provides a free [MX record checking tool](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx) that will verify your DNS configuration and suggest improvements with links to support articles.
