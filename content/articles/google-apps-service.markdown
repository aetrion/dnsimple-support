# Enabling the Google Apps Service

Google Apps for Businesses provides cloud-based email, calenders, and much more. With DNSimple's [DNS services](https://dnsimple.com) you can set up the DNS records required by Google Apps using the one-click service we provide. 


## Adding One-Click Service

From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update and then click on the Services tab.

Alternatively you can click on the *Services* button directly from the domain list.

Scroll down the page until you find the Google Apps service. Click on the *Add* button.

## Setting up At Google

Make sure to verify your domain name once you have enabled the service. You can find out more about domain name verification with Google through their [support site](https://support.google.com/a/search?q=domain+verification).
