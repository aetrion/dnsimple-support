# Enabling the Google Apps Service

Google Apps for Businesses provides cloud-based email, calenders, and much more. With DNSimple's [DNS services](https://dnsimple.com) you can set up the DNS records required by Google Apps using the one-click service we provide. 


## Adding One-Click Service

From the domain list, click on the domain name you want to update and then click on the Services tab.

Click on the *Add or Edit Services* link.

Alternatively you can click on the *Services* button directly from the domain list.

Scroll down the page until you find the Google Apps service. Click on the *Add* button.

Now the service is added. You can remove it any time by coming back to this page and clicking *Remove* next to the service.

You can also see the records that were added back on the domain's Services tab.

## Setting up At Google

Make sure to verify your domain name once you have enabled the service. You can find out more about domain name verification with Google through their [support site](https://support.google.com/a/search?q=domain+verification).

## Verifying MX Records

Google provides a free [MX record checking tool](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx) that will verify your DNS configuration and suggest improvements with links to support articles.
