This article explains the requirements for .UK domain names.

## .UK top-level registration policy {#policy-tld}

Domain registration directly at the `.UK` top-level domain was made available by Nominet on June 10th, 2014. Before that date it was only possible to register a `.UK` domain under one of the available suffixes (e.g. `.CO.UK`, `.ORG.UK`), not at the top level domain.

Because of that, domain name registrations at the second level in `.UK` name registrations are ruled by a [strict reservation policy](http://registrars.nominet.org.uk/sites/default/files/sldr_rules_140507_final_0.pdf). In summary:

- if a domain name with a `.CO.UK` (or similar extension) was registered before than October 28th, 2013, the corresponding .UK domain name is reserved for 5 years to the existing owner. If more than one qualifying 3rd level .UK domains existed before that date, the precedence will always be given to `.CO.UK`, then `.ORG.UK` ([learn more](http://registrars.nominet.org.uk/sites/default/files/sldr_rules_140507_final_0.pdf)
- if no qualifying 3rd level `.UK` domain existed before that date, then after June 10th, 2014 the `.UK` domain name will be available on a first-come-first-served basis.

`.CO.UK` domain owners have the right to register the associated `.UK` domain within a 5 years period. If a `.UK` is registered and then cancelled prior to these 5 years, the initial owner will lose the right for its re-registration.

## Transferring a .UK domain

To transfer a UK domain (i.e. example.uk or example.co.uk) into DNSimple you must provide your current registrar with our IPS tag after starting the transfer process. Our IPS tag is: `ENOM`.

To transfer a UK domain out of DNSimple send an email to support@dnsimple.com with your new registrar's IPS tag.
