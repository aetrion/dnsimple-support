# .UK Domain Names

## Transferring a .UK domain

To transfer a UK domain (i.e. example.uk or example.co.uk) into DNSimple you must provide your current registrar with our IPS tag after starting the transfer process. Our IPS tag is: `ENOM`.

To transfer a UK domain out of DNSimple send an email to support@dnsimple.com with your new registrar's IPS tag.
