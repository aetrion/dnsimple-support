# What are the Certificate Authorities used by DNSimple?

We currently offers SSL certificates signed by different globally recognized [certificate authorities](/articles/what-is-certificate-authority/):

- [Comodo](http://www.comodo.com/) for wildcard and single-name (from September 11th, 2014) SSL certificates
- [RapidSSL](http://www.rapidssl.com/) for single-name (until September 11th, 2014) SSL certificates

You can [determine the Certificate Authority](/articles/how-to-determine-certificate-authority/) by inspecting the certificate information in a browser.
