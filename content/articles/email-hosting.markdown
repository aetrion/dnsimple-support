# Email Hosting Support

At this time, we focus primarily on [domain management services](/articles/dnsimple-services), and we don't provide email hosting.

If you are looking to transfer your domain and your registrar currently provides your email then you have a few options:

1. [Use email forwarding](/articles/email-forwarding) - We provide email forwarding at $2 per month per domain, with message limits based on your plan type. With email forwarding you may forward your email to another email account such as your Gmail account.
1. Switch to Google Apps for Business - You can use our one-click template to set up the DNS for Google Apps and then go through the Google Apps signup process.
1. Select another email provider such as [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.fm/).
