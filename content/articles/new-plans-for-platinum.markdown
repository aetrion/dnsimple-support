# I'm a Platinum customer, what do the new plans mean for me?

As an existing Platinum customer you will not have access to new features in DNSimple as they are released.

Depending on the number of domains you manage in your portfolio, you may be elegible for one of our reseller plans. These plans are reserved for customers who have 100 or more domains under management, and include deep discounts on your monthly bill. You may also be elegible for discounts on domain registration and transfer prices. Contact us today at [reseller@dnsimple.com](mailto:reseller@dnsimple.com) and tell us a bit about your needs so we can find the right plan for you.

New plans includes several new features, such as:

- [Let's Encrypt integration](/articles/letsencrypt/)
- [CAA records](/articles/manage-caa-record/)
- [DNSSEC](/articles/dnssec/)

New plans also benefit from [reduced whois privacy prices](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2017/10/whois-privacy-price-decrease/).
