This article explains the requirements and special procedures for .IO domain names.

## Renewing a .IO domain

`.IO` domains are **auto-renewal only** and cannot be renewed manually at this time. The [auto-renewal feature](/articles/domain-auto-renewal) must be set 1 month before the domain will expire as explained in the ["auto-renew only" article](/articles/auto-renew-only-domains).

**The best solution is to always have auto-renewal enabled**.

<warning>
When new `.IO` domains are registered with DNSimple we default to auto-renewing the domain in order to avoid issues. **Please do not disable auto-renewal on `.IO` domains unless you are absolutely sure you do not want the domain renewed**.
</warning>

<info>
You may receive one or more emails from the `.IO` registry *after* your .IO domain has been submitted for auto-renewal but before the domain is renewed by the `.IO` registry. As long as you have received notification from us indicating your domain has been renewed, you do not need to worry about this email.
